# Organic Gardening Planner — Implementation Roadmap

> Generated: April 12, 2026
> Last updated: June 20, 2026 — **Phase B2 reconciled against the shipped bed tab** (see `docs/BED_TAB_ROADMAP_ALIGNMENT.md`): B2.11 (SVG diagram) marked superseded by the shipped visualization components (`BedTopDownMap`/`BedLayerStack`/`BedSuccessionTimeline`/`BedRowLayout`/`BedZoneIllustration`); B2.12 tests marked partially done; `BedType`/`BedLayer` and the wizard step list corrected to shipped values (6 steps incl. `BedLayoutStep`); June row-layout / succession-timeline / occupancy work captured in a new B2.17 block; dedicated `BedTasksScreen` removed from the bed tab — bed-level tasks now surface in the Care Plan only (resolves the B2.13 ↔ B2.16 contradiction). Also: **B2.12 closed** (`services/beds.test.ts` + `bedLogic.ts` extraction; backup N/A; emulator CRUD deferred). Also: **B4.5 `SeasonalAdaptationScreen` cut** — re-homed to `TodayScreen` as a Pre-Monsoon Prep card + current-season Care Rhythm card (no standalone screen/route).
> Previous: June 15, 2026 — Roadmap reconciled against shipped code: **Phase B3 (Farm Setup + Capacity) marked Complete** (consolidated into `MyFarmScreen` + `farmCapacity.ts` capacity engine + `FarmConfig` persistence); **Phase B4 (Input Recipes) marked In Progress** (`InputRecipesScreen` + recipe engine shipped; `SeasonalAdaptationScreen` still open); "Key Problems / Risks" section refreshed (schema migration + test-coverage risks resolved); gap rows G32–G36 + G1/G28 statuses updated. No code changed in this pass.
> Previous: June 3, 2026 — B2.16 shipped: farm-wide **Rotation tab** on the bed listing (Beds/Rotation segmented toggle on `BedListScreen`), reuse-first (composes `useCrossBedStatus` + `RotationStatusCard`); tasks intentionally kept in Care Plan (no Tasks tab); create/edit bed wizards untouched
> Previous: May 1, 2026 — Phase B2 complete; B2.1–B2.10 + B2.13–B2.15 shipped; B2.11 (SVG diagram) deferred; B2.12 (tests) open; gap rows G7/G12/G31/G37–G43/G45 closed; BedSizeStep raised-bed/permanent toggles removed (all beds are raised, `is_raised_bed` hardcoded `true`)
> Previous: April 30, 2026 — Roadmap expanded from bed_creation_flow.html prototype; B2 significantly expanded (6-step wizard, 8 bed types, two-tier tasks, domain helpers); Phases B3/B4 added; Phase C dashboard overhaul added; G32–G45 gap rows added; F13–F19 feature sections added
> Previous: April 26, 2026 — B.4 (growth stage auto-progression) complete; B.3 harvest tracking next
> Status: Phase 0 / A / A2 / B2 / B3 shipped; Phase B + B4 in progress; Phase C–H planned
> Scope: Solo developer, iterative build, Firebase free-tier

**Phase 0 delivered:**

- Schema migration runner (`src/migrations/`) + `schema_version` tracking on `user_settings`
- First migration: `001_backfill_district` (Kanyakumari / high_rainfall zone)
- Agro-climatic zone config extracted from `seasonHelpers.ts` into `src/config/zones/`
- `seasonHelpers.ts` functions now accept optional `zone?` param, default to `HIGH_RAINFALL_ZONE`
- Journal `tags?: string[]` field + predefined tag chips + tag filter in list view
- Fixed pre-existing broken `jest.config.js` (removed problematic setup, added `@/` path alias)
- Added tests: `seasonHelpers.test.ts` (23 tests including custom zone support)

**Phase A delivered:**

- Types: `PestEntry`, `DiseaseEntry`, `OrganicControlItem`, `PestCategory`, `DiseaseCategory`, `RiskLevel`, `TreatmentEffort`, `ControlMethod` in `database.types.ts`
- Config data: `src/config/pests/` (36 entries across 5 categories), `src/config/diseases/` (36 entries across 4 categories) with registry lookup functions
- Asset scaffolding: `src/config/referenceAssets.ts` with `getPestImage()`/`getDiseaseImage()` + `assets/reference/pests/` and `assets/reference/diseases/` directories ready for bundled WebP images
- Navigation: 4 new routes in `MoreStackParamList`, 4 screens in `AppNavigator.tsx` MoreStack, 2 new menu items in `MoreScreen.tsx`
- Styles: `referenceListStyles.ts` (search + grouped SectionList), `referenceDetailStyles.ts` (hero image, sections, treatment cards, risk badges, plant tags)
- Screens: `PestListScreen`, `PestDetailScreen`, `DiseaseListScreen`, `DiseaseDetailScreen` — grouped by category, search filter, 5 detail sections (Identification, Damage, Organic Prevention, Organic Treatment, Seasonal Risk, Plants Affected), hero image with emoji fallback
- Tests: `pests.test.ts` (13 tests), `diseases.test.ts` (12 tests) — registry shape, lookups, field completeness, treatment validation

**Phase A2 delivered:**

- Types: `Lifecycle`, `ToleranceLevel`, `FeedingIntensity`, `NumericRange` in `database.types.ts`; `PlantCareProfile` extended with 22+ optional fields (botanical identity, growing params, tolerances, nutrition/safety, user-extendable lists); `PlantCatalogCategory` extended with `tamilNames`/`descriptions`
- Data enrichment: All 100 plant varieties in `plantCareDefaults.ts` backfilled with scientific names, Tamil names (data-only), descriptions, daysToHarvest, heightCm, spacingCm, plantingDepthCm, growingSeason, germinationDays, germinationTempC, soilPhRange, tolerances, vitamins, minerals, petToxicity, feedingIntensity; fruit trees additionally have yearsToFirstHarvest
- Catalog enrichment: `tamilNames` and `descriptions` added to all 7 categories in `DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG`; `normalizeCategory()` updated to merge tamilNames/descriptions from defaults
- Consumer refactor: Removed standalone `DAYS_TO_HARVEST`, `YEARS_TO_FIRST_HARVEST`, `HARVEST_SEASON_BY_VARIETY` tables from `plantHelpers.ts`; `calculateExpectedHarvestDate()` and `getDefaultHarvestSeason()` now read from enriched care profiles
- Service layer: `normalizeOverride()` in `plantCareProfiles.ts` validates all new A2 fields; `normalizeCatalog()` exported from `plantCatalog.ts`
- Migration: `002_seed_catalog_enrichment.ts` — re-normalises existing user catalogs to merge enriched defaults; `LATEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped to 2
- UI: Known Pests and Known Diseases `CollapsibleSection`s with emoji chips in ManagePlantCatalog care modal
- Tests: `plantCareDefaultsA2.test.ts` + `plantHelpersA2.test.ts` (22 tests) — field completeness, NumericRange validation, harvest date calculation, season lookup, pest/disease retrieval

**Phase B3 delivered:**

- Type: `FarmConfig` in `database.types.ts` (`coconut_tree_count`, `families_count`, `goals[]`; `land_cents` since moved to per-plot `LocationProfile.land_cents`)
- Capacity engine: `src/services/farmCapacity.ts` — `calcUsableSqm()`, `calcMaxBeds()`, `calcWeeklyVegNeed()`, `calcCapacityFromProfiles()`, `calcCategoryPct()`, `getPhase3YearPlan()` (`YearPlan[]`), plus `getFarmConfig()`/`saveFarmConfig()` (sub-document on `user_settings/{uid}`)
- Hook: `useFarmCapacity.ts` wraps the service, reactive to FarmConfig + per-plot soil profiles
- UI: Farm Setup + Land Capacity were **consolidated into a single `MyFarmScreen`** (originally scoped as separate `FarmSetupScreen`/`LandCapacityScreen`) — plot/soil management, capacity preview (usable sqm → max beds), 3-year phase plan; reachable from MoreStack; `myFarmStyles.ts`
- Tests: capacity math covered via `plantCapacity.test.ts` + `quickStartPlanner.test.ts` (a dedicated `farmCapacity.test.ts` per B3.8 is still open)

**Phase B4 delivered (partial — In Progress):**

- Config: `src/config/organicInputs/` — `recipes.ts` (Jeevamrutha, Beejamrutha, Panchagavya, Vermiwash: ingredients, prep steps, when-to-apply, season mapping), `seasonalAdaptations.ts`, `index.ts`
- Recipe quantity engine: scales ingredient amounts by farm/bed area (pure function); `InputRecipesScreen.tsx` + `inputRecipesStyles.ts` render personalized quantities
- Pre-monsoon batch: `getPreMonsoonTasks()` task generation near the SW-monsoon onset
- Tests: `organicInputs.test.ts`, `recipeQuantity.test.ts`, `preMonsoonTasks.test.ts`
- **Still open:** Beejamrutha lifecycle deep-link (B4.4). _(B4.5 `SeasonalAdaptationScreen` was cut — content re-homed to TodayScreen cards.)_

## 2. Key Problems / Risks

> Reviewed 2026-06-15. Two previously-listed risks are now **resolved** and removed: _No Schema
> Migration System_ (migration runner + `LATEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` = 4 shipped in Phase 0; see
> `docs/SCHEMA_MIGRATIONS.md`) and _Minimal Test Coverage_ (was 2 files; now ~29 test files
> spanning utils/config/services/hooks/components). A residual test risk is reframed under Medium.

### Critical

1. **No Offline Mutation Queue**: Write failures during poor connectivity silently fail. `withTimeoutAndRetry()` retries but if all retries fail, the user's action is lost. This is the highest real-world risk for rural / low-connectivity farmers — promoted to Critical.
2. **No Onboarding**: Users land on an empty TodayScreen after signup with no guidance (G17, Phase F).

### High

1. **Hardcoded Kanyakumari Constants**: Season boundaries, location defaults ("Mangarai", "Velliavilai"), pest alerts all embedded directly in code. Expanding to other districts requires parameterization.
2. **No i18n Infrastructure**: UI screens and components have hardcoded English strings. Tamil support (Phase G) requires extracting every string first; `tamilName` data already exists from Phase A2.
3. **No Full Data Export**: Can export images but not plant/journal/task records — users cannot back up their actual data (G18, Phase F).

### Medium

1. **Direct Firestore Coupling**: Every service imports from `firebase/firestore`. Not a problem now but increases cost of any backend migration (G19).
2. **Large Hook**: `usePlantFormState` returns 120+ properties. Works but difficult to maintain.
3. **Test Coverage Shallow Despite Breadth**: ~29 test files exist, but coverage thresholds sit at 30% and only `src/utils` + `src/config` are measured; services/hooks lack emulator-backed tests, and CLAUDE.md rule #7 ("never mock Firestore — use emulator") has no emulator wired into CI. Tighten thresholds and add an emulator harness as the suite grows.

## 4. Recommended Architecture Adjustments

### 4.1 Build: Schema Migration System (G1) — ✅ Done (Phase 0)

**What**: A `src/migrations/` directory with numbered migration functions that run on app startup after auth.

**Structure**:

```text
src/migrations/
  index.ts          -- migration runner
  types.ts          -- Migration interface
  001_baseline.ts   -- no-op, establishes version 1
  002_seedCatalog.ts
  ...
```

**How it works**:

- Store `schema_version: number` in `user_settings/{uid}`
- On app launch (after auth), compare stored version vs. latest
- Run pending migrations sequentially
- Each migration transforms user's Firestore documents
- Record completed version

**Key Design Decisions**:

- Migrations run client-side (no Cloud Functions needed, stays free-tier)
- Idempotent — safe to re-run
- Batched Firestore writes (500-doc limit per batch)
- Timeout protection via existing `withTimeoutAndRetry()`

### 4.2 Build: Extract Season Config Interface — ✅ Done (Phase 0)

**What**: Move hardcoded Kanyakumari constants from `seasonHelpers.ts` into a config object, but keep Kanyakumari as the only implementation for now.

**Why now**: Every new feature (planting windows, pest calendar, weather) will embed more Kanyakumari-specific data. Extracting the config interface now prevents deeper coupling. Costs ~2 hours and pays off immediately.

**Pattern**:

- Define `SeasonConfig` interface in `database.types.ts`
- Create `src/config/kanyakumariZone.ts` exporting the current hardcoded values
- `seasonHelpers.ts` reads from the config instead of inline constants
- Add `district` field to user settings (default: "Kanyakumari")

### 4.3 Do NOT Build: Data Abstraction Layer (G19)

**Why defer**: The app has 5 service files. Each is ~200-400 lines. The Firestore SDK coupling is manageable. The abstraction would add complexity without solving a real problem today. The existing `withTimeoutAndRetry()` wrapper already centralizes retry/timeout logic. Only build this when a backend migration is actually planned.

### 4.4 Do NOT Build: Multi-User / RBAC (G20)

**Why defer**: This requires redesigning every Firestore query, security rule, and cache key. It's a fundamental architecture change, not a feature addition. Current single-farmer scope is correct for a personal app. Only revisit if actual multi-farm demand materializes.

### 4.5 Implementation Approach: Screen-by-Screen

This roadmap is organized **screen-by-screen** rather than by feature priority. Each phase targets a specific screen group, bringing it to a "done" state before moving to the next. This approach reduces context-switching for a solo developer and ensures each screen ships polished.

**Order**: Config (More tab) → Plants → Home → Calendar → Journal → Settings → Tamil i18n → Advanced

Shared foundations (types, services, config files) are built in the phase that first needs them. Each phase follows: define types → build/extend services → build/extend hooks → polish screen → write tests.

**Tamil language strategy**: Full-app English ↔ Tamil toggle in Settings (Phase G). No mixing of languages in any screen. Tamil plant names (`tamilName` on care profiles) are DATA and ship with catalog enrichment (Phase A2), but are **only displayed when the user switches to Tamil in Settings (Phase G)**. Until Phase G ships, the UI is English-only.

## 5. Phased Roadmap

### Phase 0: Stabilization (Fix Fundamentals)

**Goal**: Establish migration system and minimal test coverage so all future phases can safely change the schema and refactor code.

| Step | Feature                                       | Effort | Risk | Dependencies             |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---- | ------------------------ |
| 0.1  | Schema Migration System                       | M      | Low  | None                     |
| 0.2  | Extract Season Config Interface               | S      | Low  | None — parallel with 0.1 |
| 0.3  | Add `schema_version` to `user_settings`       | S      | Low  | 0.1                      |
| 0.4  | Service test fixtures + first 5 service tests | M      | Low  | None — parallel          |

> **Note**: Step 0.5 (Full data backup) was originally planned for Phase 0 but moved to Phase F (Settings & Cross-Cutting).

**Verification**:

- Migration runner executes on app launch, processes pending migrations
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes, `npm run lint` passes
- Service tests pass with Firebase emulator

### Phase A: Config — Pest & Disease Reference (F11)

**Goal**: Standalone browseable Pest and Disease reference screens under More tab. Pure static config, no Firestore. Simplest starting point — builds confidence and patterns for later phases.
**Screens**: PestListScreen (NEW), PestDetailScreen (NEW), DiseaseListScreen (NEW), DiseaseDetailScreen (NEW)

| A.8  | Tests: `pests.test.ts`, `diseases.test.ts`, fixture factories                                                   | S      | Low  | A.2, A.3                   |

**Verification**:

- More tab shows Pest/Disease menu items
- 36 pests + 31 diseases browseable with search filter
- Detail pages show all 5 sections (Identification, Damage Prevention, Physical Control, Organic Control, Related Plants)
- Light/dark mode correct

### Phase A3: Config — Beneficials + Custom Entry CRUD (F10) — ⏭ DEFERRED (after Phase H)

**Goal**: Beneficials reference as separate More menu item. Custom entry CRUD for pests/diseases/beneficials. Organic input recipes reference. No unified hub screen.

> **Deferred**: Skipping A3 now — Beneficials and custom CRUD are not blocking for Phase B/B2. Will revisit after Phase H.
> **Screens**: BeneficialListScreen (NEW), BeneficialDetailScreen (NEW)

**Phase B delivered so far:**

- 3-step PlantAddWizard (`PlantAddWizard.tsx`, `WizardStep1.tsx`, `WizardStep2.tsx`, `WizardStep3.tsx`) with animated step indicator, photo hero, category chips, location picker, care schedule
- PlantEditForm refactored into collapsible section components: `EditBasicInfoSection`, `EditLocationSection`, `EditCareScheduleSection`, `EditCoconutSection`
- B.1 enriched sections (5 of 7): `EditQuickInfoSection`, `EditNutritionSection`, `EditRelationshipsSection`, `EditCareGuidanceSection`, `EditSafetySection` — displayed on `PlantDetailScreen`
- B.1 remaining: `EditBotanicalIdentitySection` (not created), `EditBeneficialsSection` (deferred with A3)
- B.2 deep-links: pest/disease chips in `EditCareGuidanceSection` navigate to `PestDetailScreen`/`DiseaseDetailScreen`
- B.9 care task toggles: types on `Plant` (`watering_enabled`, `fertilising_enabled`, `pruning_enabled`), types on `PlantCareProfile` (`wateringEnabled`, `fertilisingEnabled`, `pruningEnabled`), toggle UI in `EditCareScheduleSection` + `WizardStep3`, `syncCareTasksForPlant` checks `enabled !== false`
- B.4 growth stage auto-progression: types (`GrowthStageDurations`, `AnnualCycleDurations`, `GrowthStageHistoryEntry`) in `database.types.ts`; per-variety durations for all ~99 varieties + 7 category defaults in `plantCareDefaults.ts`; fruit trees get `annualCycleDurations` + `floweringStartMonth`; coconut trees exempt; `computeExpectedGrowthStage()`, `computeAnnualCycleStage()`, `getEffectiveGrowthStage()` in `plantHelpers.ts` (priority: pinned → coconut → annual_cycle → computed → manual); `pinGrowthStage()`/`unpinGrowthStage()` in `plants.ts`; `calculateTaskPriority()` uses effective stage; `GrowthStageTimeline` vertical timeline component + `growthStageTimelineStyles.ts`; `PlantDetailScreen` shows computed stage with source badge, pin/unpin buttons, timeline; `usePlantFormState` auto-computes stage for new plants; `normalizeOverride()` validates B.4 fields; 12 tests in `growthStage.test.ts`
- Shared styles: `plantAddWizardStyles.ts`, `plantEditFormStyles.ts`, `enrichedSectionStyles.ts`, `plantFormConstants.ts`

**Verification**:

- ✅ Plant form shows 5 enriched sections (quick info, relationships, nutrition, care guidance, safety) on PlantDetailScreen
- ⚪ EditBotanicalIdentitySection not yet created
- ⚪ EditBeneficialsSection deferred (A3)
- ✅ Pest chip "Fruit Borer" → navigates to PestDetailScreen
- ⚪ Harvest log entries accumulate, PlantDetailScreen shows yield-per-season chart
- ⚪ Growth stage auto-computed from `planting_date` + variety durations (tomato planted 30 days ago shows "Vegetative")
- ⚪ Manual pin overrides computed stage; unpin reverts to computed
- ⚪ Fruit tree (mango) past `yearsToFirstHarvest` shows annual cycle: Flowering → Fruiting → Harvest → Dormancy
- ⚪ Coconut shows age stage from `getCoconutAgeInfo()`, not growth stage engine
- ⚪ `growth_stage_history` records each transition with timestamp
- ⚪ Timeline visualization on PlantDetailScreen shows all stage transitions
- ⚪ Adding sun-loving plant under coconut canopy zone shows warning
- ⚪ Plant form shows Beneficial Critters chip row (e.g. moringa → honeybees, parakeets)
- ✅ Plant form shows Nutrition section with vitamins/minerals chips
- ✅ Plant form shows expandable Growing / Feeding / Harvesting / Storage / Pruning narrative blocks
- ✅ Plant form shows red "Toxic to pets" warning for chives/onions; hidden for pet-safe plants
- ✅ Watering toggle OFF in wizard or edit → no water task created after save; ON → water task created as normal
- ✅ Fertilising toggle OFF → no fertilise task; saved state persists across edit / reload
- ✅ Pruning toggle OFF for a fruit_tree → no prune task template generated
- ✅ Smart defaults: selecting a variety whose `PlantCareProfile` has `wateringEnabled: false` auto-sets toggle to OFF
- ✅ Existing plants without the new fields continue to behave as fully enabled (no data change required)

### Phase B2: Bed Management (F12, G7, G12, G31)

**Goal**: First-class bed entities with crop rotation engine, companion/guild validation, and cross-cutting integration across all existing screens. Generic farm layout — not locked to coconut intercrop. `has_coconut_canopy` is an optional boolean property on any bed, not a bed type.
**Screens**: BedListScreen (NEW), BedDetailScreen (NEW), BedFormScreen (NEW), BedPlantPickerScreen (NEW) + modifications to 10 existing screens/components.

| B2.10 | ✅ Rotation Engine — wire `getHarvestGapWarnings()` and `getCrossBedStatus()` into `BedDetailScreen` (next family, top 3 crops, Solanaceae violation, harvest gap alert, 6-rule coordinator checklist, green manure banner, legume coverage bar, per-bed transition inputs prescription, next-crop chips); legume coverage banner on `BedListScreen`; "Mark as resting" creates 45-day chop-and-drop task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | M      | Medium | B2.5, B2.6   |
| B2.11 | ✅ Top-View / Layout Visualization _(SUPERSEDED — shipped under different names)_ — the planned single `BedDiagram.tsx` was instead delivered as a set of view-only RN components: `BedTopDownMap` (2D spatial layout), `BedRowLayout`, `BedLayerStack` (canopy→root), `BedSuccessionTimeline` (season bands + harvest bars + green-manure windows), `BedZoneIllustration` (N→S microclimate). No `react-native-svg` dependency added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | M-L    | High   | B2.5         |

| B2.13 | ✅ Two-Tier Task System — `BedTaskResolver.ts`: computes bed-level tasks (watering, Jeevamrutha, weeding, wood ash, mulch check) from plant set using min-interval for water and max-frequency for Jeevamrutha; conflict note when over-tolerant plants get more water than ideal; extend `tasks.ts` with `syncBedTasksFromPlants(bedId)`; inline `HarvestWeightInput` on task completion → updates capacity display. **Final presentation (per B2.16):** generated tasks surface in the **Care Plan only** — the standalone `BedTasksScreen` (Bed/Plant tabs) was removed from the bed tab on 2026-06-20; `BedTaskResolver`/`syncBedTasksFromPlants` are retained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | M      | Medium | B2.5, B2.10  |
| B2.14 | ✅ BedDetailScreen Enhancements — rotation history section, soil input log (last water/Jeevamrutha/weeding dates), rotation progress bar, quick action buttons (add plant, log input, rotate bed)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | S      | Low    | B2.5, B2.13  |
| B2.15 | ✅ AddPlantToCatalogScreen — standalone screen reachable from BedCreationWizard Step 4 ("Browse more") and `ManagePlantCatalogScreen` FAB (wired to `MoreStack → AddPlantToCatalog`); form fields: guild, layer, seasons, spacing, days-to-harvest, rotation family, seed source, permanent toggle, dynamic accumulator toggle, chop-drop interval, notes; saves to user's custom catalog entries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | M      | Medium | B2.5         |
| B2.16 | ✅ Bed Listing Rotation Tab — `BedListScreen` gains a **Beds / Rotation** segmented toggle (shown when `beds.length > 0`); Rotation tab = new `BedRotationView` reusing `useCrossBedStatus` + `RotationStatusCard` (new `hideGreenManure` prop) with a farm summary card (rules-met rollup, farm legume bar at the existing 20% threshold, green-manure-now banner via `getGreenManureForMonth`) + per-bed cards ("View bed" → `BedDetail`); pure `computeFarmRotationSummary` in `src/utils/farmRotationSummary.ts` (+ unit test). Tasks deliberately stay in Care Plan (no Tasks tab); create/edit wizards untouched. Reuse-first — new cross-bed rules and real harvest-gap math deferred to C.9. | S      | Low    | B2.5, B2.10  |
| B2.17 | ✅ June refinements (2026-06-20 reconcile) — **row-layout engine**: `BedRowSnapshot` + `BedRowHistoryEntry` persisted on `Bed.row_layout`/`row_history` for row-level same-family rotation history; `rowLayoutEngine.ts`, `bedEditReconcile.ts`, `bedNameGenerator.ts`, `bedStatus.ts`, `bedOccupancy.ts`, `filterAndSortBeds.ts` utils; richer single-column `BedCard` with occupancy bar; bed "Needs water" driven from plant watering state; `BedFilterSheet`, `BedCapacityModal`, `BedDeleteModal`, `ClearBedCta` components; standalone `BedRotationScreen` route; config adds `soilPrepEngine.ts`, `legumeRelevance.ts`, `plantingSequence.ts`, `layerMeta.ts`; removed list-page sort pill / attention banner; removed bed-tab `BedTasksScreen` (tasks → Care Plan). | M | Low | B2.5–B2.16 |

**Verification**:

- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes after B2.1 type additions
- Beds tab visible; all screens accessible; back navigation works
- Bed creation wizard: all 6 steps reachable, step validation blocks forward progress when required fields missing
- All 8 bed types selectable; Three Sisters shows corn/beans/pumpkin planting sequence
- Solanaceae recency check: selecting Solanaceae prev crop + recency < 12 months shows hard block (cannot proceed)
- Bed size recommendation engine: laterite soil on slope → auto-suggests compact dimensions (all beds are raised; `is_raised_bed` always `true`)
- Companion selector blocks antagonist pairs (Fennel + Brinjal → blocked with reason shown)
- Dynamic accumulators section shows Agathi/Moringa/Comfrey/Banana with chop-drop interval and nutrients mined
- Confirm step shows auto-tasks list and layout N→S preview
- Delete bed → cascade nulls plant `bed_id`
- Plant form shows bed picker dropdown; selecting bed auto-fills light zone
- `PlantCard` shows bed tag; `PlantDetailScreen` shows Bed Context section with bed-mates
- Legume coverage % visible; warning banner when < 40%
- Harvest gap detector alerts when 2 same-guild beds clear within 21 days
- Cross-bed coordinator shows all 6 rule checks with pass/fail status
- Green manure banner shows season-correct manure (e.g. Cowpea during SW monsoon)
- Bed-level tasks (water, Jeevamrutha) show merged min-interval with conflict note when plants disagree
- Plant-level tasks (sow, harvest, prune) never merged into bed-level tasks
- Harvest weight inline input updates capacity display
- "Mark as resting" sets status, creates 45-day task
- AddPlantToCatalogScreen reachable from wizard and catalog FAB; saves to custom plants
- `npm run lint` + `npm test` pass with zero errors

- Types: 7 `BedType` values (`leafy`, `fruiting`, `spice`, `root_legume`, `climber_trellis`, `three_sisters`, `medicinal_guild`), `BedSlope`, `WindExposure`, `WaterSource`, `IrrigationMethod`, `BedTaskSubtype`, `CropFamily`, `BedLayer` (`canopy`/`understory`/`ground_cover`/`root`/`climber`), `BedRowSnapshot`, `BedRowHistoryEntry`, `PestHistoryItem`, `RotationStatus`, `HarvestGapWarning`, `RotationRule`, `GreenManureRecommendation` in `database.types.ts`; `Plant` extended with `bed_id`, `bed_layer`, `sow_date`, `crop_family`, `spacing_cm`, `position_in_bed`, `light_requirement`, `season_suitability`; `TaskTemplate` extended with `bed_id`, `task_subtype`; `BedsStackParamList` added to `navigation.types.ts`
- Config: `src/config/beds/` — `guildTemplates.ts` (8 guild types + Three Sisters sequence), `greenManureEngine.ts` (Sunhemp/Cowpea/Dhaincha by season), `dynamicAccumulators.ts` (Agathi/Moringa/Comfrey/Banana + chop-drop intervals), `transitionInputs.ts` (fromFamily×toFamily→soil prep steps), `bedSizeEngine.ts` (land conditions→size recommendation + raised-bed auto-suggest), `companionRules.ts` extended with 6 antagonist blocking pairs, `rotationRules.ts` (6-rule checklist), `bedPlantCatalog.ts`
- Service: `src/services/beds.ts` (CRUD + domain functions: `getBedSizeRecommendation`, `getGreenManureForSeason`, `getTransitionInputs`, `validateCompanionPair`, `getHarvestGapWarnings`, `getCrossBedStatus`, soft-delete with cascade — `deleteBed()` nulls `bed_id` on all assigned plants via `getPlantsByBed` + `updatePlant`); `plants.ts` extended with `getPlantsByBed(bedId)`
- Hooks: `useBedData.ts`, `useBedDetail.ts`, `useBedCreationWizard.ts` (6-step state machine), `bedWizardValidation.ts`, `useCrossBedStatus.ts`, `useFarmCapacity.ts` (placeholder wired up in B3)
- Screens: `BedListScreen`, `BedDetailScreen`, `BedCreationWizardScreen` (6 steps in `BedWizardSteps/`), `BedPlantPickerScreen`, `BedRotationScreen`, `AddPlantToCatalogScreen` _(bed-tab `BedTasksScreen` removed 2026-06-20 — tasks live in Care Plan)_
- Components: `BedCard`, `BedContextSection` (used in `PlantDetailScreen`), `RotationStatusCard` (6-rule checklist), `HarvestWeightInput`; `PlantCard` gets bed chip; `SwipeableTaskCard` gets bed name via `bedMap`; `TaskCard` gets `bedName` subtitle
- Navigation: Beds added as 3rd bottom tab (`BedsStack`) in `AppNavigator.tsx`; `AddPlantToCatalogScreen` added to both `BedsStack` and `MoreStack`; `ManagePlantCatalogScreen` FAB wired to `AddPlantToCatalog`
- Cross-cutting: `PlantsScreen` group-by-bed toggle (discriminated union `ListItem`, `groupedListData` memo); `CalendarScreen` `bedMap` memo passed to `SwipeableTaskCard`; `EditLocationSection` bed dropdown
- Two-tier tasks: `BedTaskResolver.ts` computes bed-level task intervals; resolved tasks surface in the Care Plan (the standalone `BedTasksScreen` was removed from the bed tab on 2026-06-20)
- Bed listing Rotation tab (B2.16, 2026-06-03): `BedRotationView` + `bedRotationStyles.ts`, pure `src/utils/farmRotationSummary.ts` (`computeFarmRotationSummary`) with `bedRotationSummary.test.ts`, `RotationStatusCard` gains optional `hideGreenManure`, segmented-control styles in `bedListStyles.ts`; `BedListScreen` toggles Beds list vs farm-wide rotation. Reuse-first — new cross-bed rules (≥2 leafy active, no two same-guild clearing together, 40% farm target) and real harvest-date gap math (`getHarvestGapWarnings` stub) remain deferred. Tasks intentionally kept in Care Plan (no Tasks tab); create/edit wizards untouched.
- B2.11 superseded by shipped visualization components (`BedTopDownMap`/`BedLayerStack`/`BedSuccessionTimeline`/`BedRowLayout`/`BedZoneIllustration`); B2.12 ✅ done — bed util/component tests plus `services/beds.test.ts` (pure logic extracted to `services/bedLogic.ts`); `backup.ts` bed coverage is N/A (images-only); emulator-backed CRUD integration tests deferred pending emulator infra
- June 2026 additions (B2.17): row-layout engine (`row_layout`/`row_history`, `rowLayoutEngine.ts`, `bedEditReconcile.ts`), `bedStatus.ts`/`bedOccupancy.ts`/`bedNameGenerator.ts`/`filterAndSortBeds.ts` utils, `BedFilterSheet`/`BedCapacityModal`/`BedDeleteModal`/`ClearBedCta` components, `BedRotationScreen`, config `soilPrepEngine.ts`/`legumeRelevance.ts`/`plantingSequence.ts`/`layerMeta.ts`, occupancy-bar `BedCard`, needs-water-from-plant-state

### Phase B3: Farm Setup + Capacity (G32, G33, G34)

**Goal**: Global farm configuration screen + land capacity analysis. Gives the capacity engine the inputs it needs (land size, trees, families) and surfaces planning output (max beds, food category coverage, 3-year phase plan).
**Screens**: FarmSetupScreen (NEW), LandCapacityScreen (NEW)

| Step | Feature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Effort | Risk | Dependencies   |

| B3.2 | `farmCapacity.ts` service — `calcUsableSqm(cents)`, `calcMaxBeds(sqm)`, `calcWeeklyVegNeed(families)`, `calcCategoryPct(beds[], category)`, `getPhase3YearPlan(config)`                                                                                    | S      | Low  | B3.1           |
| B3.3 | `useFarmCapacity.ts` hook — wraps service, reactive to FarmConfig changes                                                                                                                                                                                  | S      | Low  | B3.2           |
| B3.4 | `FarmSetupScreen` — steppers for cents/trees/families, goals multi-select chips, live preview card showing max beds and weekly veg need                                                                                                                    | M      | Low  | B3.3           |
| B3.5 | `LandCapacityScreen` — capacity bars per food category, full-year harvest guarantee grid (category × season, red highlight for gaps), 3-year phase plan card, next-beds priority list (taps through to BedCreationWizard pre-filled with recommended type) | M      | Low  | B3.3, Phase B2 |
| B3.6 | Navigation — add both screens to MoreStack; add "Farm Setup" and "Land Capacity" items to MoreScreen                                                                                                                                                       | S      | Low  | B3.4, B3.5     |
| B3.7 | `farmSetupStyles.ts`, `landCapacityStyles.ts`                                                                                                                                                                                                              | S      | Low  | B3.4, B3.5     |

**Verification**:

- MoreScreen shows "Farm Setup" and "Land Capacity" menu items
- Changing cents stepper → all capacity numbers update reactively on same screen
- Full-year grid shows seasonal gaps highlighted in red (e.g. no leafy beds in SW monsoon)
- "Next beds" list items tap through to BedCreationWizard pre-filled with recommended bed type

### Phase B4: Input Recipes + Seasonal Adaptation (G35, G36)

**Goal**: Promote A3.7 organic recipes from deferred to shipped. Add seasonal adaptation screen with task frequency guidance and pre-monsoon batch scheduler.
**Screens**: InputRecipesScreen (NEW), SeasonalAdaptationScreen (NEW)

| Step | Feature                                                                                                                                                                      | Effort | Risk | Dependencies     |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---- | ---------------- |
| B4.1 | `src/config/organicInputs/recipes.ts` — 4 recipes (Jeevamrutha, Beejamrutha, Panchagavya, Vermiwash): ingredients, preparation steps, when-to-apply guidance, season mapping | S      | Low  | None             |
| B4.2 | `RecipeQuantityEngine` — scales ingredient amounts by `farmConfig.land_cents × bed_area`; exported as pure function                                                          | S      | Low  | B4.1, B3.1       |
| B4.3 | `InputRecipesScreen` — 4 tab panels, personalized ingredient quantities using FarmConfig, season-aware "when to apply" instructions                                          | M      | Low  | B4.1, B4.2       |
| B4.4 | Deep-link: Beejamrutha event in plant lifecycle card → `InputRecipesScreen#beejamrutha` tab                                                                                  | S      | Low  | B4.3, Phase B2   |
| B4.5 | ✅ ~~`SeasonalAdaptationScreen`~~ **CUT** (product decision) — a standalone More-tab reference screen contradicts the app's surface-in-context direction (cf. `BedTasksScreen` removal). Content re-homed to `TodayScreen`: a **Pre-Monsoon Prep card** (gated to the 21-day window; renders `PRE_MONSOON_TASKS` incl. summer shade-net) + a **current-season Care Rhythm card** (`getSeasonalCareRhythm()` → water/mulch/Jeevamrutha for the current season). No new screen/route. | M | Low | None |
| B4.6 | ✅ Pre-monsoon batch scheduler — `getDaysToSWMonsoon()` / `getPreMonsoonTasks(days)` in `src/utils/preMonsoonTasks.ts` (pure, unit-tested); surfaced on **`TodayScreen`** (Pre-Monsoon Prep card) within 21 days of Jun 1 | S | Low | B4.5 |
| B4.7 | Navigation — `InputRecipes` route in MoreStack (the `SeasonalAdaptation` route is dropped — B4.5 cut)                                                                          | S      | Low  | B4.3             |
| B4.8 | `inputRecipesStyles.ts`; seasonal-adaptation styles folded into `todayStyles.ts` (no separate `seasonalAdaptationStyles.ts` — B4.5 cut)                                       | S      | Low  | B4.3             |
| B4.9 | Tests: `organicInputs.test.ts` (recipe data completeness), `recipeQuantity.test.ts` (scaling formula), `preMonsoonTasks.test.ts` (task generation near Jun 1)                | S      | Low  | B4.1, B4.2, B4.6 |

**Verification**:

- Recipe quantities update when farm cents change in FarmSetup
- Beejamrutha deep-link from plant lifecycle card navigates to InputRecipesScreen on Beejamrutha tab
- Within 21 days of Jun 1 → Pre-Monsoon Prep card appears on TodayScreen (shade-net task included); hidden outside the window; dismissible per day
- Current season → Care Rhythm card on TodayScreen shows correct water/mulch/Jeevamrutha intervals (e.g. SW Monsoon → Rain-fed / fortnightly / every 15 days)

| C.14 | TipStrip — dismissible daily advice strip driven by `alerts.ts` highest-priority tip (e.g., legume coverage below 40%); dismiss persisted in AsyncStorage keyed by `tip_dismissed_YYYY-MM-DD` so same tip doesn't reappear same calendar day                                                                                                                                                                                                | S      | Low    | C.10                    |
| C.15 | Enhanced TodayScreen task list — replaces B2.9 placeholder; each row: checkbox (toggles via `completeTask()`), task name, bed tag chip (colored by bed type), type icon + label, time stamp or red "Overdue" badge; overdue tasks sorted to top; "See all" links to CalendarScreen; wires `useTodayTasks()`                                                                                                                                 | S      | Low    | C.11, Phase B2.13       |

## 6. Feature-Level Breakdown

### F1: Schema Migration System (Phase 0.1)

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

- Add `schema_version: number` to a new `UserSettings` base interface
- Add `MigrationRecord` interface: `{ version: number; ran_at: string; status: 'success' | 'failed' }`

**New Files**:

- `src/migrations/index.ts` — migration runner with `runPendingMigrations(uid)`, reads `schema_version` from `user_settings/{uid}`, executes pending migrations
- `src/migrations/types.ts` — `Migration` interface: `{ version: number; name: string; up: (uid: string) => Promise<void> }`
- `src/migrations/001_baseline.ts` — no-op, establishes version 1

**Integration Point** (`App.tsx`):

- Call `runPendingMigrations(user.uid)` after `onAuthStateChanged` confirms user, before rendering main app
- Show migration progress indicator if migrations are running

**Service Changes**: None for baseline. Future features add migration files.

**Risks**: Migration failures mid-batch could leave partial data. Mitigation: each migration is idempotent, records progress per-document if needed.

---

### F2: Curated Default Catalog (Phase A2) — Planter-Inspired

**Scope expanded (2026-04-18)**: Extend beyond Tamil names + spacing to the full Planter-style plant-reference schema, Kanyakumari-adapted.

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

- Extend `PlantCatalogCategory` with per-variety fields:

  ```typescript
  tamil_names?: Record<string, string>
  descriptions?: Record<string, string>         // per-variety prose (e.g. "Garlic chives: midway between garlic and onion")
  aliases?: Record<string, string[]>             // already exists — retained
  certifications?: Record<string, string[]>      // e.g. ['organic']
  ```

- Extend `PlantCareProfile` with **Botanical Identity**:

  ```typescript
  scientificNames?: string[];                    // ["Allium schoenoprasum", "Allium tuberosum"]
  taxonomicFamily?: string;                      // "Alliaceae" — enables Phase 3.2 crop rotation
  lifecycle?: 'annual' | 'biennial' | 'perennial';
  description?: string;                          // long-form, ~300–800 chars
  tamilName?: string;
  tamilDescription?: string;
  ```

- Extend `PlantCareProfile` with **Quick Information (all ranges, metric + °C)**:

  ```typescript
  spacing?: { valuePerSqM?: number; cmBetweenPlants?: number };
  plantingDepthCm?: { min: number; max: number };
  waterPerWeekMm?: { min: number; max: number };
  sunRange?: { min: SunlightLevel; max: SunlightLevel };
  growingSeason?: KKSeason[];                    // zone season IDs — feeds F3
  heatTolerance?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';     // replaces Planter's frostTolerance
  droughtTolerance?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';  // new for TN summer
  waterloggingTolerance?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'; // critical for SW/NE monsoons
  germinationDays?: { min: number; max: number };
  germinationTempC?: { min: number; max: number };
  heightCm?: { min: number; max: number };
  daysToHarvest?: { min: number; max: number };
  soilPhRange?: { min: number; max: number; label?: string };
  ```

- Extend `PlantCareProfile` with **Nutrition**, **Safety**, **Feeding intensity**:

  ```typescript
  vitamins?: string[];                           // ["A", "B9", "C", "K"]
  minerals?: string[];                           // ["calcium", "iron", "choline", "sulfur"]
  macronutrients?: string[];                     // ["fibre", "protein"]
  nutritionSource?: string;                      // "ICMR-NIN" | "USDA"
  petToxicity?: { dogs?: 'safe' | 'mild' | 'toxic'; cats?: 'safe' | 'mild' | 'toxic'; notes?: string };
  feedingIntensity?: 'light' | 'medium' | 'heavy';
  ```

- Extend `PlantCareProfile` with **User-Extendable Lists** (hybrid configurability — static base + user custom additions per variety):

  ```typescript
  customPests?: string[];                      // user-added pest names not in reference data
  customDiseases?: string[];                   // user-added disease names not in reference data
  customBeneficials?: string[];                // user-added beneficial critter names not in reference config
  ```

  These fields are user-additions only. Static base lists come from `getCommonPests()`/`getCommonDiseases()` in `plantHelpers.ts` and `getBeneficialsForPlant()` in `config/beneficials/`. Display merges both: `[...staticList, ...customList]`. The existing shallow spread `{ ...base, ...override }` works because custom fields don’t exist on the static base profile.

**Files Modified**:

- `src/services/plantCatalog.ts` — expand `DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG` with 30–40 Kanyakumari crops, Tamil names, per-variety descriptions, TNAU-recommended varieties (Nendran, G9, ASD16, ADT37, PKM1, PLR1, East Coast Tall, TxD)
- `src/utils/plantCareDefaults.ts` — backfill the 40+ variety defaults with the full Planter-style field set above
- `src/migrations/002_seedCatalog.ts` — seeds Quick-Info, nutrition, safety, and botanical identity fields; merges with user overrides rather than overwriting

**Reuse**: Existing `getPlantCatalog()` normalization already merges defaults with user data. Existing `getPlantCareProfile()` hook auto-fills the new fields onto the form.

**Enables**: F3 (growingSeason), F9 (form sections), Phase 3.2 crop rotation (taxonomicFamily).

---

### F3: Season-Aware Planting Calendar (Phase C)

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

- Add `PlantingWindow` interface:

  ```typescript
  {
    canSow: boolean;
    canTransplant: boolean;
    notes: string;
  }
  ```

- Extend `PlantCareProfile` with:

  ```typescript
  planting_windows?: Record<KKSeason, PlantingWindow>
  ```

- **Note (2026-04-18)**: `PlantingWindow` derivation now reads from the new `PlantCareProfile.growingSeason: KKSeason[]` field introduced in F2 rather than ad-hoc logic. For profiles without explicit `planting_windows`, infer `canSow = currentSeason ∈ growingSeason`.

**Files Modified**:

- `src/utils/plantCareDefaults.ts` — add `planting_windows` to variety-level defaults
- `src/screens/TodayScreen.tsx` — add "What to Plant Now" section using current season + care profile planting windows
- `src/styles/todayStyles.ts` — styles for new section
- `src/components/PlantNowBanner.tsx` — **NEW** zone-aware "Plant now ✅ / Wait until X" badge rendered at top of the plant edit form (replaces Planter's "Set Frost Dates" flow — Kanyakumari has no frost)

**Reuse**: `getCurrentSeason()` from `seasonHelpers.ts`, `getPlantCareProfile()` from `plantCareDefaults.ts`, zone season labels from `src/config/zones/`.

---

### F4: Weather Integration (Phase C)

**New Files**:

- `src/services/weather.ts` — `getWeatherForecast(lat, lng): WeatherForecast` with Open-Meteo API call, 3h cache via `dataCache`

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

- `WeatherForecast`, `DailyWeather` interfaces

**Files Modified**:

- `src/screens/TodayScreen.tsx` — weather card showing 7-day forecast, rain alert
- `src/styles/todayStyles.ts` — weather card styles
- `src/services/tasks.ts` — optional: suppress watering reminder if rain predicted

**API**: Open-Meteo free API (no key needed):

```text
https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=8.08&longitude=77.57&daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min,precipitation_sum&timezone=Asia/Kolkata
```

**Kanyakumari Default Coordinates**: 8.0883°N, 77.5385°E (configurable per user later via district field)

---

### F5: Enhanced Harvest Tracking (Phase B)

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

```typescript
interface HarvestLog {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  plant_id: string;
  harvested_at: string; // ISO date
  quantity: number;
  unit: 'kg' | 'count' | 'bunch' | 'litre';
  quality_grade?: 'good' | 'average' | 'poor';
  destination: 'consumed' | 'sold' | 'given_away';
  sale_price?: number; // INR
  buyer_market?: string; // "Nagercoil Uzhavar Sandhai"
  photo_filename?: string;
  notes?: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

**New Files**:

- `src/services/harvests.ts` — CRUD following cache → auth → Firestore → fallback pattern
- `src/migrations/003_harvestLogs.ts` — migrate existing `JournalEntry` harvest data to `harvest_logs`
- `src/styles/harvestDashboardStyles.ts` — yield chart styles

**Files Modified**:

- `firestore.rules` — add `harvest_logs/{logId}` rules
- `src/lib/storage.ts` — add `KEYS.HARVEST_LOGS`
- `src/lib/dataCache.ts` — add `CACHE_KEYS.HARVEST_LOGS`
- `src/components/HarvestHistorySection.tsx` — read from `harvest_logs` instead of journal
- `src/screens/PlantDetailScreen.tsx` — add yield trend mini-chart (`react-native-svg` already in deps)

**Reuse**: Existing `HarvestHistorySection` component, `react-native-svg` for charts.

---

### F6: Growth Stage Auto-Progression + Annual Cycling (Phase B)

**Approach**: Computed on-the-fly from `planting_date` + per-variety stage durations stored on `PlantCareProfile`. No background jobs, no timers. The function `getEffectiveGrowthStage(plant, careProfile)` is called at render time on `PlantDetailScreen` and `PlantCard`. Manual pin/unpin allows the user to override the computed stage (e.g. "I see flowers" → pin to Flowering).

**Design Decisions**:

- **Computed, not stored**: The "current" growth stage is derived from elapsed days since `planting_date` + profile durations. Only explicit manual overrides (`growth_stage_pinned`) and historical transitions (`growth_stage_history`) are persisted to Firestore.
- **Pin/unpin**: When a user manually selects a stage, `growth_stage_pinned` is set to that stage. `getEffectiveGrowthStage()` returns pinned stage if set, otherwise computes. User can "Clear override" to unpin.
- **Annual cycling for fruit trees**: After `yearsToFirstHarvest` elapses, fruit trees enter a repeating annual cycle: Flowering → Fruiting → Harvest → Dormancy. The cycle start month varies by species (mango: Dec, jackfruit: Dec, lemon: Feb, guava: continuous).
- **Coconut exempt**: Coconut trees use the existing `getCoconutAgeInfo()` function which computes 6 age stages. They are excluded from the growth stage engine.
- **Timber trees**: Progress through Seedling → Vegetative → Mature, then stay at Mature permanently.

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

```typescript
// Extend PlantCareProfile
growthStageDurations?: Partial<Record<GrowthStage, number>>;  // days per stage
annualCycleDurations?: Partial<Record<GrowthStage, number>>;  // days per annual cycle stage (fruit trees)
floweringStartMonth?: number;  // 1-12, month when annual cycle begins (e.g. 12 for mango)

// Extend Plant interface
growth_stage_pinned?: GrowthStage | false;  // manual override, false = use computed
growth_stage_history?: Array<{
  stage: GrowthStage;
  entered_at: string;   // ISO date
  source: 'computed' | 'manual';
  notes?: string;
}>;
```

**Stage Sequences by PlantType**:

| PlantType      | Linear Stages                                          | Annual Cycle (after maturity)             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `vegetable`    | Seedling → Vegetative → Flowering → Fruiting → Harvest | None (replant)                            |

**Annual Cycling Data** (Kanyakumari fruit trees):

| Variety     | floweringStartMonth | Cycle                                                    | Notes                          |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Mango       | 12 (Dec)            | Flower(60d) → Fruit(90d) → Harvest(30d) → Dormant(185d)  | One main season                |
| Jackfruit   | 12 (Dec)            | Flower(45d) → Fruit(120d) → Harvest(45d) → Dormant(155d) | Long fruiting                  |
| Banana      | —                   | One-shot: Flower → Fruit → Harvest → **replant**         | No cycling, sucker replant     |
| Papaya      | continuous          | Flower(30d) → Fruit(120d) → Harvest(30d) → repeat        | Near-continuous after maturity |
| Guava       | continuous          | Flower(30d) → Fruit(90d) → Harvest(30d) → repeat         | Two flushes per year           |
| Lemon/Lime  | 2 (Feb)             | Flower(30d) → Fruit(150d) → Harvest(60d) → Dormant(125d) | Main + minor flush             |
| Pomegranate | 2 (Feb)             | Flower(30d) → Fruit(150d) → Harvest(30d) → Dormant(155d) | Monsoon harvest                |

**Computation Engine**:

```typescript
// New file: src/utils/growthStageHelpers.ts

/** Compute the expected linear growth stage from planting_date + durations */
export function computeExpectedGrowthStage(
  plantingDate: string,
  plantType: PlantType,
  durations: Partial<Record<GrowthStage, number>>
): { stage: GrowthStage; daysInStage: number; daysRemaining: number };

/** For fruit trees past yearsToFirstHarvest, compute annual cycle position */
export function computeAnnualCycleStage(
  plantingDate: string,
  yearsToFirstHarvest: number,
  floweringStartMonth: number,
  cycleDurations: Partial<Record<GrowthStage, number>>
): { stage: GrowthStage; daysInStage: number; daysRemaining: number } | null;

/** Top-level: returns pinned stage if set, otherwise computed (linear or annual) */
export function getEffectiveGrowthStage(
  plant: Plant,
  careProfile: PlantCareProfile
): {
  stage: GrowthStage;
  source: 'pinned' | 'computed' | 'annual_cycle';
  daysInStage: number;
  daysRemaining: number;
};
```

**Stage Duration Derivation** (for profiles lacking explicit `growthStageDurations`):

- `seedling` = `germinationDays.max + 7` (or 21 days default)
- Remaining days (`daysToHarvest.max - seedling`) split by plant type:
  - Vegetables: Vegetative 40%, Flowering 25%, Fruiting+Harvest 35%
  - Herbs: Vegetative 60%, Harvest 40%
  - Flowers: Vegetative 40%, Flowering 40%, Harvest 20%
  - Fruit trees: Vegetative until `yearsToFirstHarvest`, then Mature + annual cycle

**Files Modified**:

- `src/types/database.types.ts` — new fields on `PlantCareProfile` and `Plant`
- `src/utils/plantCareDefaults.ts` — add `growthStageDurations` / `annualCycleDurations` / `floweringStartMonth` for 40+ varieties
- `src/utils/growthStageHelpers.ts` — **NEW** (3 exported functions above)
- `src/services/plants.ts` — `pinGrowthStage(plantId, stage)`, `unpinGrowthStage(plantId)`, `appendGrowthStageHistory(plantId, entry)`
- `src/screens/PlantDetailScreen.tsx` — growth timeline visualization, pin/unpin button, annual cycle indicator
- `src/components/PlantCard.tsx` — show computed stage badge
- `src/__tests__/utils/growthStageHelpers.test.ts` — **NEW** unit tests

**Migration**: `004_growthStageHistory.ts`:

- For each plant with `growth_stage` and `created_at`, seed `growth_stage_history` with one entry `{ stage, entered_at: created_at, source: 'computed' }`
- Set `growth_stage_pinned = false` on all plants

**Edge Cases**:

- No `planting_date` → show "Set planting date to track growth" prompt, no computation
- No `growthStageDurations` on profile → derive from `daysToHarvest` using split ratios above
- Dormancy → manual stage only (user marks "I'm overwintering this plant")
- Banana → one-shot lifecycle, no annual cycling, prompt "Replant sucker?" after harvest
- Pre-bearing perennials (fruit tree < yearsToFirstHarvest) → show "X years until first harvest" instead of annual cycle

### F7: Zone-Based Planting (Phase B)

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

```typescript
// Add to Plant interface
planting_zone?: 'under_canopy' | 'partial_shade' | 'open_sun' | 'border_fence' | 'raised_bed';
```

**Files Modified**:

- `src/utils/plantHelpers.ts` — extend companion logic with zone-aware rules
- `src/components/forms/EditLocationSection.tsx` — add zone picker
- `src/screens/PlantFormScreen.tsx` — show companion warnings when zone selected
- `src/services/plants.ts` — include zone in queries

**New Files**:

- `src/utils/zoneCompanionRules.ts` — zone-specific companion/antagonist matrix (pepper loves coconut shade, turmeric under banana, etc.)

> **Note**: F7 Zone-Based Planting is subsumed by Phase B2 Bed Management (bed light zones + guild layers). See F12 below.

---

### F12: Bed Management (Phase B2)

**Design**: Generic farm bed layout — works for any organic garden, not locked to coconut intercrop. The `has_coconut_canopy` field is an optional boolean property on any bed, not a bed type. Beds are first-class Firestore entities linked to plants via `bed_id`.

**Cross-Cutting Impact** — 16 existing screens/components need bed awareness:

| Existing File                           | Integration                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PlantFormScreen` / `usePlantFormState` | Bed picker dropdown replaces free-text `bedName`; `bedId`/`bedLayer` state; auto-fill light zone from bed |
| `EditLocationSection.tsx`               | Bed dropdown (populated from `getBeds()`) when `spaceType === "bed"`                                      |
| `WizardStep2.tsx`                       | Bed picker in wizard step 2 location section                                                              |
| `PlantCard.tsx`                         | Bed tag badge from `bed_id` (replaces static `bed_name` display)                                          |
| `PlantDetailScreen.tsx`                 | New "Bed Context" section: bed name, dimensions, layer, bed-mates, companion indicators                   |
| `TaskCard.tsx`                          | Bed subtitle below plant name (e.g. "Tomato #3 · Bed A")                                                  |
| `PlantFilterSheet.tsx`                  | New "Bed" filter section with chips per bed name + plant counts                                           |
| `PlantsScreen.tsx`                      | "Group by bed" option in sort/group controls                                                              |
| `CalendarScreen.tsx`                    | Add `"bed"` to `GROUP_OPTIONS` for bed-grouped task view                                                  |
| `TodayScreen.tsx`                       | Bed overview card: bed count, occupancy %, legume coverage %, beds needing rotation                       |
| `JournalFormScreen.tsx`                 | Bed picker (bed-level observations: soil prep, mulching, rotation notes)                                  |
| `JournalScreen.tsx`                     | "Filter by bed" chip; bed badge on entry cards                                                            |
| `plants.ts` (service)                   | `getPlantsByBed(bedId)` — new query with composite index `user_id + bed_id`                               |
| `storage.ts`                            | Add `KEYS.BEDS_CACHE`                                                                                     |
| `dataCache.ts`                          | Add `CACHE_KEYS.BEDS`, `CACHE_KEYS.BED_DETAIL`                                                            |
| `firestore.rules`                       | Add `beds/{bedId}` owner-only read/write rules                                                            |

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

> ⚠️ **Superseded by shipped types.** The block below is the original April prototype
> design and diverges from what shipped — see the authoritative `Bed` interface in
> `src/types/database.types.ts` (e.g. `type` not `bed_type`, a `dimensions` object
> instead of `width_m`/`length_m`, `sunlight`/`soil_type`/`slope`/`wind` land
> conditions, and `row_layout`/`row_history` row snapshots; bed status is derived in
> `src/utils/bedStatus.ts`, not stored as a `BedStatus` field). Type lists corrected
> below to match shipped values.

```typescript
// New types (as shipped)

**Config Data** — new `src/config/beds/` directory:

| File                    | Content                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Service Functions** (`src/services/beds.ts`) — follows `plants.ts` pattern (cache → `refreshAuthToken()` → `withTimeoutAndRetry()` → update cache → AsyncStorage fallback):

| Function                          | Purpose                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `getBeds()`                       | Paginated, offline-first, cache key `CACHE_KEYS.BEDS`                    |

| `assignPlantToBed(...)`           | Updates plant `bed_id` + `bed_layer` + updates bed `current_crop_family` |
| `removePlantFromBed(plantId)`     | Sets plant `bed_id = null`                                               |
| `getRotationSuggestion(bedId)`    | Reads `crop_family_history`, returns next family + top 3 crops           |
| `markBedResting(bedId, restCrop)` | Sets status = resting, creates 45-day task via `createTaskTemplate()`    |
| `getLegumeCoveragePercent()`      | `(beds in legume/rest) / (total non-permanent beds)`                     |

**Domain Helpers** (`src/utils/bedHelpers.ts`) — pure functions, no Firestore:

| Function                                  | Purpose                                                |

| `getLightZoneFromSunHours(hours)`         | Derives `LightZone` from numeric sun hours             |
| `getGuildValidationWarnings(bed, plants)` | Canopy count, tulsi spacing, marigold missing, etc.    |

**New Files** (22):

- `src/config/beds/` — 6 config files
- `src/services/beds.ts` — CRUD service
- `src/utils/bedHelpers.ts` — pure domain logic
- `src/hooks/useBedData.ts`, `src/hooks/useBedDetail.ts` — data hooks
- `src/screens/BedListScreen.tsx`, `BedDetailScreen.tsx`, `BedFormScreen.tsx`, `BedPlantPickerScreen.tsx`
- `src/components/BedCard.tsx`
- `src/styles/bedListStyles.ts`, `bedDetailStyles.ts`, `bedFormStyles.ts`, `bedPlantPickerStyles.ts`, `bedCardStyles.ts`
- `src/__tests__/utils/bedHelpers.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/services/beds.test.ts`

**Decisions**:

- **Generic, not coconut-intercrop**: `has_coconut_canopy` is optional boolean. Any farm layout works.
- **New top-level Beds tab**: 3rd of 5 tabs (Home · Plants · **Beds** · Care Plan · More), icon `grid-outline`. Journal moves to MoreStack. Verify layout on 320dp during B2.5.
- **Separate bed catalog**: `src/config/beds/bedPlantCatalog.ts` does NOT modify existing `plantCareDefaults.ts`.
- **No migration needed**: All Plant/JournalEntry extensions are optional fields (null default). Beds collection is new.
- **SVG deferred**: B2.11 not implemented until B2.1–B2.10 verified stable. Data integrity before cosmetics.
- **Solanaceae 2-year rule**: Blocking warning with user override, not a hard block.
- **`area_sqm`**: Computed client-side (`width_m × length_m`), not stored in Firestore.
- **Existing phase overlaps subsumed**: G7 (zone planting) → B2 light zones; G12 (crop rotation) → B2.10 rotation engine; B.5 (zone-based planting) → B2 bed light zones + guild layers; H.1 partially → B2.10; H.2 partially → B2 bed entities.

### F8: Voice-to-Text (Phase E)

**Files Modified**:

- `src/screens/JournalFormScreen.tsx` — add microphone button next to content input
- `src/styles/journalFormStyles.ts` — mic button styles

**Dependencies**: `@react-native-voice/voice` (requires dev client, not Expo Go)

---

### F9: Planter-Style Plant Form Enrichment (Phase B)

**Goal**: Bring Planter.garden's depth to the plant-edit form — botanical identity, quick-info ranges, beneficials, nutrition, narrative care, safety — adapted for Kanyakumari (no frost; metric; monsoon-aware; pet toxicity).

**Configurability Model (Hybrid)**:

- **Fully read-only** (static config, displayed but never user-edited): botanical identity, nutrition (vitamins/minerals/superfood from ICMR-NIN/USDA), pet toxicity, companion/incompatible plants, narrative care content.
- **User-extendable** (static base + user custom additions per variety via ManagePlantCatalog care modal): pests, diseases, beneficial critters. Three new `custom*` fields on `PlantCareProfile` (see F2). ManagePlantCatalog care modal gets 3 new collapsible sections showing static chips (greyed, read-only) + user chips (removable) + "Add custom" input.
- **Per-plant observations** (existing, unchanged): `Plant.pest_disease_history` via `PestDiseaseModal`.

**Data Categorization**:

_Fully Read-Only_ (static config — no user editing):

| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `pest_disease_history: PestDiseaseRecord[]` | `Plant` document | `PestDiseaseModal` |

**Merge Logic**:

`customPests`/`customDiseases`/`customBeneficials` are separate from the static lists — they don't exist on the base `PlantCareProfile`. The existing shallow spread `{ ...base, ...override }` works unchanged. Display layer merges: `[...getCommonPests(type, variety), ...override.customPests ?? []]`. Custom entries render as removable chips; static entries render as read-only greyed chips. `normalizeOverride()` in `plantCareProfiles.ts` needs only a trim/deduplicate validation pass for the 3 new array fields — no structural change to the merge algorithm.

**ManagePlantCatalog Screen Changes**:

Add 3 new collapsible sections below the existing care frequency fields in the care profile modal:

1. **Known Pests** — static reference pests as read-only greyed chips + user `customPests` as removable chips + "Add custom pest" text input
2. **Known Diseases** — same pattern as pests
3. **Known Beneficial Critters** — config beneficials as read-only chips + user `customBeneficials` as removable chips + "Add custom beneficial" input

`CareFormState` extension: add `customPests: string[]`, `customDiseases: string[]`, `customBeneficials: string[]`.

**UX Flows**:

_Adding a custom pest to a variety (e.g. "Scale Insects" for Mango)_:

1. More → Manage Plant Catalog → Fruit → Mango → care profile modal
2. Scroll to "Known Pests" — static pests shown as read-only greyed chips
3. Type "Scale Insects" → tap Add → removable chip appears
4. Save → stored in `user_settings/{uid}.plantCareProfiles.Fruit.Mango.customPests`

_Viewing pest data on a plant_:

1. PlantEditForm → `EditRelationshipsSection` shows reference pests + custom pests (merged, read-only chips)
2. Tap any pest chip → navigates to PestDetailScreen (F11 / F10)
3. "Customize in Manage Plant Catalog" link to add custom entries

_Browsing reference screens (F11 / F10)_:

1. More → Pests / Diseases / Beneficials (separate menu items)
2. Pest list → searchable list grouped by category (Sap-Sucking, Borers, etc.)
3. Tap "Aphids" → PestDetailScreen with Identification, Organic Prevention, Organic Treatment cards, Seasonal Risk, Plants Affected

_Recording an actual pest incident (per-plant history)_:

1. "Add Pest/Disease Record" on PlantEditForm → existing `PestDiseaseModal`
2. Records date, pest name, treatment, outcome → saved to `Plant.pest_disease_history`
3. This is per-plant observation history, not catalog-level reference data

**Schema additions**: All new fields live on `PlantCareProfile` (catalog-level, shared across all instances of a variety). Per-plant overrides continue to use existing `Plant` fields. No duplication. See F2 for the full extended type definition.

**New Form Components** (inserted into `PlantEditForm.tsx` between `EditCareScheduleSection` and `Plant Health`, each with colocated `*Styles.ts`):

| Component                          | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EditBotanicalIdentitySection.tsx` | Read-only: scientific names, taxonomic family, lifecycle, Tamil name, description                                                                                                                                                   |
| `EditQuickInfoSection.tsx`         | Editable (auto-filled from variety): spacing, depth, water, sun range, growing season, 3-axis tolerance, germination, height, days-to-harvest, soil pH                                                                              |
| `EditRelationshipsSection.tsx`     | Companion plants, antagonist plants, common pests, common diseases — chip rows; pest/disease/beneficial chips are **tappable deep-links** to detail pages (F10); "Customize in Manage Plant Catalog" link for adding custom entries |
| `EditBeneficialsSection.tsx`       | Horizontal `FlatList` of beneficial-critter image chips; tap → **BeneficialDetailScreen** (F10); shows merged static + custom beneficials                                                                                           |
| `EditNutritionSection.tsx`         | Read-only: vitamin/mineral/macro chip rows (ICMR-NIN/USDA source, no user editing)                                                                                                                                                  |
| `EditCareGuidanceSection.tsx`      | Expandable text blocks: Growing-from-Seed, Feeding, Harvesting, Storage (fresh/frozen/dried), Pruning                                                                                                                               |
| `EditSafetySection.tsx`            | Conditional (only if `petToxicity` present) — dog/cat badges with notes                                                                                                                                                             |

**New Reference Data**:

- `src/config/beneficials/index.ts` — registry + `getBeneficialById(id)` / `getBeneficialsForPlant(ids)`
- `src/config/beneficials/kanyakumari.ts` — ~20 regionally-meaningful species with bundled image assets (honeybees, ladybird, trichogramma, parakeets, bulbuls, dragonflies, earthworms, praying mantis, spiders, etc.)

**Supporting Component**:

- `src/components/PlantNowBanner.tsx` — zone-aware "Plant now ✅ / Wait until X" badge (see F3)

**Reuse**:

- `CollapsibleSection` — every new section
- `FloatingLabelInput`, `ThemedDropdown` — numeric inputs + unit selectors
- `getCurrentSeason()` / `getSeasonLabel()` from `seasonHelpers.ts`
- `getPlantCareProfile()` for auto-fill from selected variety
- `expo-image` with `cachePolicy="memory-disk"` for beneficial critter thumbnails
- Existing companion/antagonist helpers in `plantHelpers.ts` (770+ pairs, 30+ incompatibilities)

**Wizard changes**: None. Step 3 ("How") already covers sunlight/water/fertiliser. New fields auto-populate from variety profile on save. Add-wizard stays 3 steps.

**Tests**:

- `src/__tests__/config/beneficials.test.ts` — registry shape + lookup tests
- `src/__tests__/utils/plantCareDefaults.test.ts` — every variety has mandatory Quick Info fields populated; range `min ≤ max`
- `src/__tests__/migrations/002_seedCatalog.test.ts` — idempotent; preserves user customisations

**Risks**:

- Asset bundle growth from beneficial-critter images — mitigate with compressed WebP, ~40 KB each, ~1 MB total for 20 species
- Migration 002 must merge not overwrite — existing normalisation pattern in `plantCatalog.ts` already handles this

### F10: Beneficials + Custom Entry CRUD (Phase A3) — ⏭ DEFERRED

**Goal**: Browseable reference pages for beneficial critters as a separate More menu item, plus custom entry CRUD for pests/diseases/beneficials — adapted for organic gardening in Kanyakumari. Consolidates the existing scattered data (~52 `ORGANIC_TREATMENTS`, ~140 `TREATMENT_DETAILS`, ~37 `PEST_CATEGORY_MAP`/`DISEASE_CATEGORY_MAP`, 14 crops in `TAMIL_NADU_CROP_SPECIFIC_ISSUES`) into structured reference types with detail screens.

**Prerequisite**: F11 (Phase A) implements the standalone Pest & Disease reference screens first — static config files, two list screens, two detail screens, no Firestore reads. F10 builds on top: adding the Beneficials reference, custom entry CRUD, and deep-links from plant forms. Implement F11 before F10.

**Planter Section Mapping (Organic KK Adaptation)**:

| Chemical Control  | **OMITTED**                     | Organic-only app — no synthetic chemicals                      |
| Plants Affected   | **Plants Affected**             | Tappable chips navigating to plant detail                      |

| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GardenReferenceScreen`  | `GardenReference`  | 3-tab layout (Pests / Diseases / Beneficials), searchable `FlatList`, FAB to add custom entry                                                  |
| `PestDetailScreen`       | `PestDetail`       | Full detail with Identification, Organic Prevention, Organic Treatment (with recipe/method cards), Seasonal Risk badges, Plants Affected chips |
| `DiseaseDetailScreen`    | `DiseaseDetail`    | Same layout as PestDetailScreen                                                                                                                |
| `BeneficialDetailScreen` | `BeneficialDetail` | Common Species, Why Helpful, Identification, How To Attract, Plants To Grow, Pests Controlled, Seasonal Presence                               |

**New Config Files**:

- `src/config/pests/index.ts` — registry + `getPestById()` / `getAllPests()` / `getPestsForPlant(variety)`
- `src/config/pests/kanyakumari.ts` — ~40 pest entries consolidated from `plantHelpers.ts` scattered data
- `src/config/diseases/index.ts` — registry + `getDiseaseById()` / `getAllDiseases()`
- `src/config/diseases/kanyakumari.ts` — ~30 disease entries

**New Service**:

- `src/services/gardenReference.ts` — manages custom pest/disease/beneficial entries; reads/writes `user_settings/{uid}.customPestReferences`, `customDiseaseReferences`, `customBeneficialReferences`; merges static + custom for display

**New Style Files**:

- `src/styles/gardenReferenceStyles.ts`
- `src/styles/pestDetailStyles.ts`
- `src/styles/diseaseDetailStyles.ts`
- `src/styles/beneficialDetailStyles.ts`

**Navigation Changes** (`AppNavigator.tsx`):

- Add 4 routes to `MoreStack`: `GardenReference`, `PestDetail`, `DiseaseDetail`, `BeneficialDetail`
- Deep-link navigation from form screens uses `navigation.navigate('MoreTab', { screen: 'PestDetail', params: { id } })`

**Deep-Link Integration Points** (F10 → existing screens):

- `PestDiseaseModal` — pest/disease name chips become tappable, navigate to detail screen
- `EditRelationshipsSection` — pest/disease chip rows deep-link to detail screens
- `EditBeneficialsSection` — beneficial critter chips deep-link to BeneficialDetailScreen
- `PestDiseaseHistorySection` — history entries deep-link to reference pages for that pest/disease

**Custom Entry Storage** (in `user_settings/{uid}`):

```typescript
customPestReferences?: PestReference[];     // isCustom = true
customDiseaseReferences?: DiseaseReference[];
customBeneficialReferences?: BeneficialReference[];
```

**Custom Entry CRUD**:

- Add via GardenReferenceScreen FAB → form with minimal required fields (name, category, identification)
- Add via ManagePlantCatalog care modal → same form, auto-links to current variety's `customPests`/`customDiseases`/`customBeneficials`
- Edit/delete from detail screen header menu
- Custom entries appear alongside static entries in all lists, distinguished by subtle badge

**Scope Boundaries**:

_Included_:

- 4 reference screens: `GardenReferenceScreen` (3-tab container), `PestDetailScreen`, `DiseaseDetailScreen`, `BeneficialDetailScreen`
- ~130 enriched entries in static config (`src/config/pests/`, `src/config/diseases/`, `src/config/beneficials/`)
- Custom entry CRUD stored in `user_settings/{uid}` via `gardenReference.ts` service
- Deep-links from pest/disease/beneficial chips across the app (`PestDiseaseModal`, `EditRelationshipsSection`, `EditBeneficialsSection`, `PestDiseaseHistorySection`)
- FAB "+" to add custom entries from `GardenReferenceScreen`; edit/delete from detail screen header menu
- ~55 bundled reference images (WebP, ~40 KB each)
- `getMergedPests()` / `getMergedDiseases()` helpers in `plantHelpers.ts`

_Excluded (current scope)_:

- User-editable nutrition data or pet toxicity data
- User-editable companion/incompatible plant lists (Phase H candidate)
- Custom organic treatment recipes per pest
- Per-plant custom pest/disease additions (use existing `PestDiseaseModal` for per-plant observation history)

**Tests**:

- `src/__tests__/config/pests.test.ts` — registry shape, lookup, all entries have required fields
- `src/__tests__/config/diseases.test.ts` — same pattern
- `src/__tests__/services/gardenReference.test.ts` — CRUD, merge logic, custom + static deduplication

**Risks**:

- Data consolidation from scattered `plantHelpers.ts` maps into structured `PestReference`/`DiseaseReference` is the main effort — ~2 days of manual mapping
- Cross-stack navigation (from PlantEditForm in PlantsStack to MoreStack) requires `CompositeNavigationProp` — already documented in navigation standards

---

### F11: Pest & Disease Reference Screens (Phase A)

**Goal**: Two standalone browseable reference screens directly accessible from the More tab — one for Pests, one for Diseases. Each has a searchable list view (grouped by category) and a full detail page. All data is static in-app config — no Firestore reads, no migration needed. The existing scattered pest/disease constants in `plantHelpers.ts` are consolidated into structured config files under `src/config/`.

**Scope**: Static reference only. Custom entry CRUD (G30) and deep-links from plant forms (2.15) are separate steps that build on top of this foundation.

#### Field Design

| User Field        | Type                   | Source                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name              | `string`               | Keys from `PEST_CATEGORY_MAP` / `DISEASE_CATEGORY_MAP`                                                                                                   |
| Scientific Name   | `string?`              | Authored per entry (e.g. _Bactrocera dorsalis_, _Ralstonia solanacearum_)                                                                                |
| Images            | `imageAsset?: string`  | Reserved for future bundled WebP assets — rendered as placeholder now                                                                                    |
| Identification    | `string[]`             | Authored: 2–4 observable field symptoms per entry                                                                                                        |
| Damage Prevention | `string[]`             | `ORGANIC_TREATMENTS[name]` filtered where `TREATMENT_DETAILS[t].method === 'cultural'`                                                                   |
| Physical Control  | `string[]`             | `ORGANIC_TREATMENTS[name]` filtered where `method === 'trap' \| 'manual'`                                                                                |
| Organic Control   | `OrganicControlItem[]` | `ORGANIC_TREATMENTS[name]` filtered where `method === 'spray' \| 'biocontrol' \| 'soil'`; each item carries `method` + `effort` from `TREATMENT_DETAILS` |
| Related Plants    | `string[]`             | Inverted from `TAMIL_NADU_CROP_SPECIFIC_ISSUES` (pest/disease → crops it affects → map to variety names in `DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG`)                      |

**Physical vs Organic Control distinction** (important for Kanyakumari farmers):

- **Physical/Damage Prevention** = free, labour-based or cultural methods (traps, pruning, hygiene, crop rotation)
- **Organic Control** = prepared materials (neem oil sprays, bio-agents, soil drenches) — may require purchase or preparation time

---

#### Data Model Changes (`database.types.ts`)

Add after `JournalEntry`:

```typescript
export type PestCategory =
  | 'Sap-Sucking'
  | 'Mites & Spiders'
  | 'Borers & Larvae'
  | 'Beetles & Weevils'
  | 'Other Pests';

export type DiseaseCategory = 'Fungal' | 'Bacterial' | 'Viral' | 'Other';

export interface OrganicControlItem {
  name: string;
  method: 'spray' | 'trap' | 'biocontrol' | 'soil' | 'manual' | 'cultural';
  effort: 'easy' | 'moderate' | 'advanced';
}

export interface PestEntry {
  id: string; // kebab-slug: 'aphids', 'red-palm-weevil'
  name: string;
  scientificName?: string;
  tamilName?: string;
  category: PestCategory;
  emoji: string;
  imageAsset?: string; // future: bundled require() path
  identification: string[]; // 2–4 observable symptom strings
  damagePrevention: string[]; // cultural / preventive methods
  physicalControl: string[]; // traps, manual removal, barriers
  organicControl: OrganicControlItem[];
  relatedPlants: string[]; // variety names from DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG
}

export interface DiseaseEntry {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  scientificName?: string; // causal organism: 'Alternaria solani'
  tamilName?: string;
  category: DiseaseCategory;
  emoji: string;
  imageAsset?: string;
  identification: string[];
  damagePrevention: string[];
  physicalControl: string[];
  organicControl: OrganicControlItem[];
  relatedPlants: string[];
}
```

Union literals (not enums) for categories because the existing `PEST_CATEGORY_MAP` / `DISEASE_CATEGORY_MAP` already use these exact strings — direct compatibility, no mapping layer needed.

---

#### Config File Structure (mirrors `src/config/zones/` exactly)

```text
src/config/pests/
├── types.ts          — re-exports PestEntry, PestCategory, OrganicControlItem from database.types
├── kanyakumari.ts    — KANYAKUMARI_PESTS: PestEntry[]  (36 entries)
└── index.ts          — ALL_PESTS, getPestById(), getAllPests(),
                         getPestsForPlant(varietyName), getPestsByCategory()

src/config/diseases/
├── types.ts          — re-exports DiseaseEntry, DiseaseCategory, OrganicControlItem
├── kanyakumari.ts    — KANYAKUMARI_DISEASES: DiseaseEntry[]  (31 entries)
└── index.ts          — ALL_DISEASES, getDiseaseById(), getAllDiseases(),
                         getDiseasesForPlant(varietyName), getDiseasesByCategory()
```

**Data population for kanyakumari.ts files**:

- `id` ← kebab-slug of `name` (e.g. `'black-headed-caterpillar'`)
- `category` + `emoji` ← `PEST_CATEGORY_MAP[name]` / `DISEASE_CATEGORY_MAP[name]`
- `damagePrevention` ← treatments from `ORGANIC_TREATMENTS[name]` where `TREATMENT_DETAILS[t].method === 'cultural'`
- `physicalControl` ← treatments where `method === 'trap' | 'manual'`
- `organicControl` ← treatments where `method === 'spray' | 'biocontrol' | 'soil'`, enriched with `method` + `effort` from `TREATMENT_DETAILS`
- `relatedPlants` ← invert `TAMIL_NADU_CROP_SPECIFIC_ISSUES`: for each pest/disease find all 13 crop keys whose `.pests[]` / `.diseases[]` includes it; map crop key → variety names from `DEFAULT_PLANT_CATALOG`
- `identification` ← authored (2–4 field-observable symptoms per entry, ~4h domain writing)
- `scientificName` ← authored for ~20 priority pests/diseases

**Example entry (Aphids)**:

```typescript
{
  id: 'aphids',
  name: 'Aphids',
  scientificName: 'Aphis gossypii',
  tamilName: 'பேன்',
  category: 'Sap-Sucking',
  emoji: '🪰',
  identification: [
    'Clusters of tiny soft-bodied insects on new growth and leaf undersides',
    'Sticky honeydew residue on leaves causing secondary black sooty mold',
    'Curled or distorted new leaves and shoot tips',
    'Ants moving up and down stems (farming the aphids for honeydew)',
  ],
  damagePrevention: [
    'Intercrop with marigold or coriander to repel',
    'Maintain garden hygiene — remove weeds that harbour aphids',
  ],
  physicalControl: [
    'Dislodge with strong water jet in the morning',
    'Yellow sticky traps near affected plants',
    'Manual removal by hand-wiping or brushing',
  ],
  organicControl: [
    { name: 'Neem oil spray (2–3 ml/L)', method: 'spray', effort: 'easy' },
    { name: 'Soapnut water spray', method: 'spray', effort: 'easy' },
    { name: 'Garlic-chili spray', method: 'spray', effort: 'easy' },
    { name: 'Lady beetle release', method: 'biocontrol', effort: 'advanced' },
  ],
  relatedPlants: [
    'Country Tomato', 'Hybrid Tomato', 'Cherry Tomato',
    'Bird\'s Eye', 'Gundu Chilli', 'Long Chilli',
    'Brinjal', 'Long Brinjal', 'Drumstick',
    'Banana', 'Mango', 'Papaya', 'Lemon', 'Jasmine',
  ],
}
```

---

#### Navigation Changes

**`src/types/navigation.types.ts`** — extend `MoreStackParamList`:

```typescript
PestList: undefined;
PestDetail: {
  pestId: string;
}
DiseaseList: undefined;
DiseaseDetail: {
  diseaseId: string;
}
```

Add 6 convenience prop types: `PestListScreenNavigationProp`, `PestDetailScreenNavigationProp`, `PestDetailScreenRouteProp`, `DiseaseListScreenNavigationProp`, `DiseaseDetailScreenNavigationProp`, `DiseaseDetailScreenRouteProp`.

**`src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`** — add 4 `Stack.Screen` entries to `MoreStack`.

**`src/screens/MoreScreen.tsx`** — fix navigation type (`NavigationProp<ParamListBase>` → typed `NativeStackNavigationProp<MoreStackParamList, 'MoreHome'>`); add 2 menu items (`bug-outline` icon → PestList, `medkit-outline` icon → DiseaseList) before the Settings item.

---

#### Screen Architecture

**Shared style files** (avoids duplicate StyleSheet definitions for structurally identical screens):

- `src/styles/referenceListStyles.ts` — shared by `PestListScreen` and `DiseaseListScreen`
- `src/styles/referenceDetailStyles.ts` — shared by `PestDetailScreen` and `DiseaseDetailScreen`

**PestListScreen / DiseaseListScreen**:

- No async loading — static config, zero Firestore reads
- `searchInput: string` (controlled) + `searchQuery: string` (300ms debounce, `useRef<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>>` — same pattern as `PlantsScreen.tsx`)
- `sections = useMemo(...)` — `getAllPests()` filtered by query, grouped into `SectionList` sections by `PestCategory`
- `SectionList` with `renderItem`, `renderSectionHeader`, `keyExtractor` all in `useCallback`; `removeClippedSubviews` + `windowSize={10}`
- Header: back button + screen title + `TextInput` search bar above the list
- Empty state: centred "No results" text when filter matches nothing

**PestDetailScreen / DiseaseDetailScreen**:

- `const pest = useMemo(() => getPestById(pestId), [pestId])` — synchronous
- Guard: if `!pest` render "Not found" fallback (no crash)
- `ScrollView` with `useSafeAreaInsets()` top/bottom + `TAB_BAR_HEIGHT` bottom padding
- Custom back-button header matching `PlantDetailScreen` pattern (`insets.top + 12`)
- **Hero**: `pest.emoji` (large) + `pest.name` (bold) + `pest.scientificName` (italic, if present) + `pest.tamilName` (if present)
- **5 content sections** (plain View cards, matching `plantDetailStyles.ts` card pattern):

| Section           | Field                | Visual                                                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identification    | `identification[]`   | Bullet list prefixed with "•"                                                     |
| Damage Prevention | `damagePrevention[]` | Bullet list; `shield-checkmark-outline` icon                                      |
| Physical Control  | `physicalControl[]`  | Bullet list; `hand-left-outline` icon                                             |
| Organic Control   | `organicControl[]`   | Row: method emoji + name + `getTreatmentEffortDot(effort)` from `plantHelpers.ts` |
| Related Plants    | `relatedPlants[]`    | Wrapping chip row; tap → `ManagePlantCatalog`                                     |

**Reused from existing code**:

- `getTreatmentEffortDot(effort)` → 🟢/🟡/🔴 (`plantHelpers.ts`)
- `TREATMENT_METHOD_META` pattern → method emoji (spray=💨, trap=🪤, biocontrol=🐞, soil=🌱, manual=✋, cultural=🔄) (`plantHelpers.ts`)
- `TAB_BAR_HEIGHT` (`FloatingTabBar`)
- `useSafeAreaInsets`, `useTheme`, `useNavigation`, `useRoute` — standard screen setup
- Card/section visual patterns from `plantDetailStyles.ts` (copy rules, don't import)
- 300ms debounce pattern from `PlantsScreen.tsx`

**Modified files**: `database.types.ts`, `navigation.types.ts`, `AppNavigator.tsx`, `MoreScreen.tsx`

---

#### Tests

- `src/__tests__/config/pests.test.ts` — `getAllPests()` = 36 items; every entry has `id`, `name`, `category`, `emoji`; `getPestById('aphids')` returns correct entry; `getPestById('nonexistent')` = `undefined`; `getPestsForPlant('Country Tomato')` includes Aphids; all `organicControl[].method` values are valid union members
- `src/__tests__/config/diseases.test.ts` — same structural tests for 31 diseases
- `src/__tests__/fixtures/pestEntry.fixtures.ts` — `makePestEntry(overrides?)` factory
- `src/__tests__/fixtures/diseaseEntry.fixtures.ts` — `makeDiseaseEntry(overrides?)` factory

---

#### Verification Criteria

1. `npx tsc --noEmit` exits zero
2. `npm run lint` exits zero
3. `getAllPests()` = 36, `getAllDiseases()` = 31 (data completeness check)
4. More tab shows "Pest Reference" and "Disease Reference" menu items
5. PestListScreen renders all 36 pests grouped under 5 category headings
6. Search "weevil" filters within 300ms to matching pests; clear restores full list
7. Tapping a pest row navigates to `PestDetailScreen` — all 5 sections populated
8. Organic Control items show effort dots (🟢/🟡/🔴) and method emoji
9. Tapping a Related Plants chip navigates to `ManagePlantCatalogScreen`
10. Back button from any screen returns correctly without stack issues
11. Light mode and dark mode render correctly (no hardcoded hex values)
12. `DiseaseListScreen` / `DiseaseDetailScreen` behave identically with disease data

---

### F13: Farm Setup + Capacity Engine (Phase B3)

**Goal**: Collect global farm parameters (land size, trees, families, goals) once and feed a capacity engine that tells the user how many beds they can create, what food categories they need, and whether the farm can sustain the household year-round.

**Data Model Changes** (`database.types.ts`):

```typescript
type FarmGoal = 'self_sufficiency' | 'surplus_sale' | 'seed_saving' | 'medicinal' | 'fodder';

interface FarmConfig {
  land_cents: number; // 1 cent = 40.47 sqm
  coconut_tree_count: number;
  families_count: number;
  goals: FarmGoal[];
  updated_at: string;
}
```

Stored as sub-document on `user_settings/{uid}.farmConfig` — no new Firestore collection.

**New Files**:

- `src/services/farmCapacity.ts` — pure computation functions: `calcUsableSqm(cents)` (cents × 40.47 × 0.7 usable factor), `calcMaxBeds(sqm)`, `calcWeeklyVegNeed(families)`, `calcCategoryPct(beds[], category)`, `getPhase3YearPlan(config)`
- `src/hooks/useFarmCapacity.ts` — wraps service, reactive to FarmConfig
- `src/screens/FarmSetupScreen.tsx` — stepper UI for cents/trees/families, goals chips, live preview
- `src/screens/LandCapacityScreen.tsx` — capacity bars per food category, full-year harvest guarantee grid (category × 4 seasons, red cells = gap), 3-year phase plan card, next-beds priority list (taps through to BedCreationWizard pre-filled)
- `src/styles/farmSetupStyles.ts`, `src/styles/landCapacityStyles.ts`
- `src/__tests__/services/farmCapacity.test.ts`

**Navigation**: Both screens added to MoreStack; MoreScreen gets "Farm Setup" and "Land Capacity" menu items.

---

### F14: Organic Input Recipes — Personalized (Phase B4)

**Goal**: Four complete organic input recipes (Jeevamrutha, Beejamrutha, Panchagavya, Vermiwash) with ingredient quantities auto-scaled to the user's actual farm size, accessible from a standalone screen and deep-linked from plant lifecycle events.

**Recipe Data Structure** (`src/config/organicInputs/recipes.ts`):

```typescript
interface RecipeIngredient {
  name: string;
  baseQtyPerCent: number;
  unit: string;
  notes?: string;
}

interface OrganicInputRecipe {
  id: 'jeevamrutha' | 'beejamrutha' | 'panchagavya' | 'vermiwash';
  name: string;
  tamilName: string;
  ingredients: RecipeIngredient[];
  preparationSteps: string[];
  whenToApply: string;
  seasonMapping: KKSeason[];
}
```

**New Files**:

- `src/config/organicInputs/recipes.ts` — 4 recipe objects
- `src/utils/recipeQuantityEngine.ts` — `scaleRecipe(recipe, farmConfig)` pure function
- `src/screens/InputRecipesScreen.tsx` — 4 tab panels with personalized quantities
- ~~`src/screens/SeasonalAdaptationScreen.tsx`~~ **CUT** — content re-homed to `TodayScreen` (Pre-Monsoon Prep card + current-season Care Rhythm card)
- `src/styles/inputRecipesStyles.ts` (seasonal-adaptation styles folded into `todayStyles.ts`)
- `src/__tests__/utils/recipeQuantity.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/config/organicInputs.seasonalRhythm.test.ts`

**Pre-monsoon batch scheduler** (`src/utils/preMonsoonTasks.ts`): `getDaysToSWMonsoon()` + `getPreMonsoonTasks(daysToSWMonsoon)` — returns bed-prep, mulch, shade-net tasks when `0 ≤ daysToSWMonsoon ≤ 21`; rendered as the TodayScreen Pre-Monsoon Prep card.

**Deep-link**: Beejamrutha event on plant lifecycle card navigates to `InputRecipesScreen` on the `beejamrutha` tab.

---

### F15: Seasonal Adaptation + Pre-Monsoon Batch Scheduler (Phase B4)

**Goal**: Surface season-specific task frequency changes to the user and auto-generate a batch of pre-monsoon preparation tasks when the season approaches.

> **Delivery note (B4.5 cut):** no standalone screen. The adaptation table is surfaced as a current-season Care Rhythm card on `TodayScreen` (`getSeasonalCareRhythm()`), and the pre-monsoon batch as a dismissible Pre-Monsoon Prep card gated to the 21-day window.

**Season Adaptation Rules** (stored in `src/config/organicInputs/seasonalAdaptations.ts`):

| Season               | Water        | Mulch             | Jeevamrutha   |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Summer (Mar–May)     | Every 2 days | Check weekly      | Every 10 days |
| SW Monsoon (Jun–Sep) | Rain-fed     | Check fortnightly | Every 15 days |
| NE Monsoon (Oct–Dec) | Every 3 days | Check weekly      | Every 12 days |
| Cool Dry (Jan–Feb)   | Every 3 days | Check monthly     | Every 14 days |

**Pre-Monsoon Batch Tasks** (generated ~21 days before Jun 1):

- Lay fresh mulch on all active beds
- Install shade-net on fruiting beds
- Prepare first Jeevamrutha batch of the season
- Clean and inspect drip lines
- Sow Cowpea green manure on resting beds

**Files**: Extends `src/services/tasks.ts` with `getPreMonsoonTasks()`; `SeasonalAdaptationScreen` renders adaptation table + task list with countdown.

---

### F16: Two-Tier Task System (Phase B2)

**Goal**: Separate bed-level tasks (one per bed, shared by all plants) from plant-level lifecycle events (one per plant). Resolves conflicting plant care intervals at the bed level using deterministic rules.

**Architecture**:

- **Bed-level tasks**: watering, Jeevamrutha application, weeding, wood ash, mulch check — computed once per bed from the set of plants assigned to it. Interval resolution: min-interval wins for watering (most water-sensitive plant dictates the schedule); max-frequency wins for Jeevamrutha (most demanding plant dictates enrichment frequency). Conflict note added to task card when a high-water-need plant coexists with a drought-tolerant plant.
- **Plant-level tasks**: sow, thin, transplant, harvest, prune, chop-drop (for dynamic accumulators) — each plant has its own schedule based on its own `sow_date` and `PlantCareProfile`. Never merged into bed-level tasks.

**New Files**:

- `src/services/BedTaskResolver.ts` — `resolveBedTasks(bed, plants)` returns `ResolvedBedTask[]` with winner, interval, conflict note
- `src/screens/BedTasksScreen.tsx` — two-tab view: Bed Tasks tab (bed-level) + Plant Tasks tab (plant lifecycle events per plant); inline harvest weight number input on harvest task completion
- `src/styles/bedTasksStyles.ts`
- `src/__tests__/services/BedTaskResolver.test.ts` — min-interval, conflict detection, accumulator chop-drop scheduling

**Extends**: `src/services/tasks.ts` — `syncBedTasksFromPlants(bedId)` regenerates bed-level tasks when plants are added/removed; harvest weight input → updates capacity % in `useFarmCapacity`.

### F17: Needs Attention Scroll (Phase C)

**Goal**: Surface the most urgent farm alerts on TodayScreen as a horizontal-scroll card row. Simpler than a swipe-dismiss stacked deck — no `PanResponder` needed. Cards are tappable and navigate to the relevant screen.

> **Note**: A swipe-dismiss stacked deck (`StackedAlertDeck`) was considered but deferred. Horizontal scroll covers the required UX at lower complexity; the swipe variant can be revisited as a future enhancement if user research shows a need.

**Alert Types** (`FarmAlert` union in `src/types/database.types.ts`):

```typescript
type FarmAlertType =
  | 'harvest_due'
  | 'water_needed'
  | 'trellis_repair'
  | 'prune_due'
  | 'rotation_due'
  | 'pest_spotted'
  | 'bed_resting_end';

interface FarmAlert {
  id: string;
  type: FarmAlertType;
  bedId?: string;
  plantId?: string;
  message: string;
  severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'critical';
  created_at: string;
}
```

**New Files**:

- `src/services/alerts.ts` — `getFarmAlerts(beds, plants, tasks)` aggregates across all beds and plants into `FarmAlert[]`; replaces ad-hoc TodayScreen alert logic
- `src/components/NeedsAttentionScroll.tsx` — horizontal `ScrollView` of attention cards (max 4 shown); each card: tinted emoji bg by urgency, urgency badge (red=critical, orange=warning), name, bed label, action text; tapping navigates to relevant screen
- `src/styles/needsAttentionScrollStyles.ts`

**Integration**: `TodayScreen` renders `<NeedsAttentionScroll alerts={farmAlerts.filter(isActionable)} />`. `FarmHealthCard` (`C.7`) and `TipStrip` (`C.14`) also consume `farmAlerts`.

### F18: Dynamic Accumulators — Chop-Drop Tracking (Phase B2)

**Goal**: Track the four key dynamic accumulators (Agathi, Moringa, Comfrey, Banana) in beds and auto-generate chop-drop pruning tasks based on configurable intervals and nutrient mining profiles.

**Accumulator Config** (`src/config/beds/dynamicAccumulators.ts`):

| Plant                  | Chop-Drop Interval | Nutrients Mined | Notes                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Agathi (Sesbania)      | 45 days            | N, Ca           | Fast-growing, fixes N            |
| Moringa                | 60 days            | N, P, K, Ca, Mg | Multipurpose; harvest leaves too |
| Comfrey                | 30 days            | K, Ca, P        | Deep tap root                    |
| Banana (after harvest) | Per-bunch          | K, Mg           | Chop pseudostem after harvest    |

**Task Generation**: When a dynamic accumulator plant is assigned to a bed, `syncBedTasksFromPlants(bedId)` adds a recurring `chop_drop` task at the configured interval. Task card shows nutrients that will be returned to soil.

**New Types** (`database.types.ts`):

```typescript
interface DynamicAccumulator {
  plantVariety: string;
  chopDropIntervalDays: number;
  nutrientsMined: string[];
  specialTrigger?: 'post_harvest';
}
```

### F19: Cross-Bed Rotation Coordinator + Harvest Gap Detector (Phase B2)

**Goal**: Farm-wide rotation intelligence that ensures no bed has a same-family repeat, legume coverage stays at 40%+, permanent beds are excluded from rotation, and two beds of the same guild don't clear within 21 days of each other.

**Six-Rule Coordinator** (`getCrossBedStatus(beds[])` in `beds.ts`):

| Rule                           | Check                                                          | Severity                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Legume coverage ≥ 40%          | `(legumeBeds + restingBeds) / nonPermanentBeds ≥ 0.4`          | Warning if < 40%, critical if < 25% |
| No same-family adjacent cycle  | `isSolanaceaeViolation(history)` for each bed                  | Critical                            |
| Permanent beds exempt          | Skip permanent beds in rotation checks                         | Info                                |
| Legume in every rotation cycle | Each 4-bed rotation sequence includes at least one legume slot | Warning                             |
| Harvest gap ≥ 21 days          | No two same-guild beds clear within 21 days                    | Warning                             |
| Green manure on resting beds   | Season-correct manure planted when status = resting            | Info                                |

**Harvest Gap Detector** (`getHarvestGapWarnings(beds[])` in `beds.ts`): Groups beds by `bed_type`, finds pairs with `last_rotation_date` within 21 days, returns `HarvestGapWarning[]` with suggested delay recommendation.

**UI Integration**:

- `BedDetailScreen` — coordinator checklist section (6 rules, pass/fail per rule with fix suggestion)
- `BedListScreen` — legume coverage banner (progress bar, % label, warning if below target)
- `BedListScreen` — **Beds / Rotation** in-screen toggle (B2.16): the Rotation tab surfaces the farm-wide coordinator (rules-met rollup, farm legume bar, green-manure-now) + per-bed `RotationStatusCard`s via `BedRotationView`. Reuse-first; new farm rules and harvest-gap math deferred to C.9
- Dashboard Rotation tab (Phase C.9) — full coordinator view with season countdown, harvest gap alerts, per-bed rotation cards

## 7. Data & Migration Strategy

### Migration System Design

1. **Version tracking**: `user_settings/{uid}.schema_version` (integer, starts at 0)
2. **Migration files**: `src/migrations/NNN_descriptiveName.ts`, each exports `{ version, name, up(uid) }`
3. **Runner**: `src/migrations/index.ts` — `runPendingMigrations(uid)`:
   - Read current `schema_version`
   - Filter migrations where `version > current`
   - Run sequentially
   - Update `schema_version` after each success
   - Log failures to Sentry, don't crash app
4. **Idempotency**: Each migration checks if transformation already applied before modifying
5. **Batch limits**: Process max 500 docs per `writeBatch()` (Firestore limit)

### Migration Timeline (by Phase)

| Migration              | Phase      | Schema Change                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 001_backfill_district  | Phase 0 ✅ | District + zone backfill (Kanyakumari / high_rainfall)                      |
| 002_seedCatalog        | Phase A    | Enriches catalogs with Tamil names/varieties, botanical identity, nutrition |
| 003_harvestLogs        | Phase B    | Creates `harvest_logs` from journal harvest entries                         |
| 004_growthStageHistory | Phase B    | Initializes `growth_stage_history` from current stage                       |
| 005_plantingZones      | Phase B    | Adds `planting_zone` to plants                                              |

> **Removed from plan**: `003_plantingWindows` — planting windows are config data on care profiles, not user data requiring migration. `007_journalTags` — already shipped in Phase 0.

### Risky Data Changes

- **004_harvestLogs**: Creates new collection from existing journal data. Must NOT delete original journal entries (they remain as the source of truth). Harvest logs are a materialized view.
- **002_seedCatalog**: Must merge with user customizations, not overwrite. Use existing normalization pattern in `plantCatalog.ts`.

## 8. Final Recommendations

### DO NOW (Phase A–A2 — Config) ✅ SHIPPED

1. ~~**Build Pest & Disease reference screens (F11)**~~ — ✅ shipped Phase A
2. ~~**Enrich default catalog (F2)**~~ — ✅ shipped Phase A2
3. ~~**Build Beneficials + custom entry CRUD (F10)**~~ — ⏭ deferred to after Phase H (not blocking)

### DO NEXT (Phase B–B2–C — Plants, Beds & Home)

1. **Planter-style form depth (F9)** — 7 new sections, high perceived polish
2. **Harvest tracking (F5)** — concrete value farmers care about
3. **Growth stage auto-progression + annual cycling (F6)** — computed stages, fruit tree cycling, pin/unpin override
4. **Bed Management (F12, Phase B2)** — first-class bed entities, crop rotation engine, guild validation, cross-cuts 16 existing files. Subsumes F7 zone-based planting, G7, G12.
5. **Deep-links from forms to reference screens (2.15)** — connects form chips to detail pages
6. **"What to Plant Now" on TodayScreen (F3)** — farmers' #1 question, leverages enriched profiles
7. **Weather card (F4)** — simple API call, high daily-use value

### DO AFTER (Phase D–F)

1. **Calendar weather refinements (Phase D)** — watering suppression on rainy days
2. **Voice-to-text Tamil (F8, Phase E)** — removes literacy barrier
3. **Full data backup (G18, Phase F)** — data loss is a trust-breaker
4. **Onboarding flow (G17, Phase F)** — district selection + guided first-plant wizard

### DO LATER (Phase G–H)

1. **Tamil i18n** — only after all screens feature-complete (extracting strings from moving targets is waste)
2. **Farm mapping remainder, soil recs, lifecycle economics** — deeper domain intelligence (crop rotation moved to Phase B2)

### DO NOT BUILD (Current Stage)

| Feature                    | Reason                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-User / RBAC          | Rewrites entire data model. No demand from a personal-use app.                           |
| Financial Ledger           | Accounting is a different product. Start with `sale_price` on harvest_logs.              |
| Data Abstraction Layer     | 5 small service files don't justify the abstraction cost. Build when migrating backends. |
| Labour Tracking            | Niche enterprise need. Track worker costs as notes on task_logs for now.                 |
| Water Management Module    | Covered by weather integration + existing watering tasks.                                |
| State-Level Zone Expansion | Build Kanyakumari bulletproof first. Other zones = same template with different data.    |
| Government Scheme Tracker  | External data dependency with no reliable API. Link to websites instead.                 |
| Full Plot GPS Mapping      | String-based zones + bed names are sufficient for half an acre.                          |

### Architecture Principles for All Phases

1. **Schema changes go through migrations** — no more "hope old data works"
2. **New collections follow the existing service pattern** — cache → auth → Firestore → fallback
3. **Domain data is config, not code** — season boundaries, pest alerts, planting windows should be data objects, not inline logic
4. **Static reference data stays in-app** — organic recipes, farmer's almanac, pest reference images are app assets, not Firestore (keeps free-tier viable)
5. **Test new services** — every new service file (`harvests.ts`, `weather.ts`) gets unit tests from day one

## Design Decisions (Open for Discussion)

### Coconut Per-Tree Tracking Model

- **Option A**: `tree_number` field on `HarvestLog` linking to existing `Plant` entry — simpler, "harvested 45 nuts from tree #7"
- **Option B**: Separate `CoconutTree` child collection under a parent `Plant` — supports per-tree care schedules
- **Recommendation**: Option A first. Upgrade to B only if farmers need per-tree watering/fertilising differences.

### Farmer's Almanac Location

- **Option A**: Static content rotating monthly on `TodayScreen`
- **Option B**: Dedicated screen in More tab with full-year view
- **Recommendation**: Both — monthly highlight on TodayScreen with "View full almanac" link.

### Voice-to-Text Library

- `expo-speech` handles TTS only, not STT
- `@react-native-voice/voice` requires dev client (not Expo Go), supports Tamil well
- **Recommendation**: `@react-native-voice/voice` since `expo-dev-client` is already in use.

### Harvest Logs vs. Extended Task Logs

- **Option A**: New `harvest_logs` collection — clean separation, purpose-built fields (sale_price, buyer_market, destination)
- **Option B**: Extend existing `task_logs` with harvest fields — less migration, reuses existing service
- **Recommendation**: Option A. Harvests have fundamentally different data needs (quantity, market, income) that don't fit the task completion model.
